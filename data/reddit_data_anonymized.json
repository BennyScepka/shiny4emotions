    "text": "I'll keep this simple. since the recent introduction of AI tools to society, we have seen a rising trend of complaints regarding the legality of both the training of AI and its use in regards to copyright.\n\nthe two main arguments i hear are as follows: \n\nAI training violates copyright laws. they did not gain permission from the content creators to use their content in AI training, so therefore they have violated copyright law.\n\ncontent produced by AI utilizes elements of copyrighted works, again without permission. and this again is violating copyright law.\n\nmy stance is as follows. AI and the companies that operate them are not doing anything the average person couldn't do themselves given their own time and resources. it is absolutely within the bounds of the law to hear a musician you like, or read a book and enjoy it ,then turn that into inspiration and produce your own works that are inspired by those works.\n\nif these companies had instead hired thousands of humans to take classes and educate them on writing and music production and video production and simply made a content production farm that operates on request, would that be different? would that violate laws? if the end result were more or less the same? \n\nthe only real difference here is that AI is faster, and more accessible than the knowledge or tools utilized in the production of these works. this is a natural progression of technology. things have always trended towards easier to produce with less skill and less investment. it used to be that the only way you could READ a book let alone write it was to be wealthy. now anybody could spend a few bucks on a pad of paper and a pen and write to their heart's content. this is yet another evolution of the paper and the pen. it just happens to do some of the thinking for you too. but fundamentally it's nothing you would be fully incapable of doing. it's not magic, it's just a simplification and reduction in cost of an existing process. \n\n  \n",

Thus AI being trained on other people's work to be used and recreated is also not allowed.\n\nIf a human saw a concept and thought of an idea, for example if I made Breddit entirely from my own thoughts based on Reddit, that would be fine. But AI doesn't have thoughts or ideas, AI has the actual content and formulates suggestions based on the actual content.

If your logic is true, then they should just hire \"a thousand humans and educate them\", because they cannot copy your 3rd party research papers to train new humans (or AI) for a profit.\n\n\nSimilarly, in a translation analogy, you cannot just distribute 1 copy of Harry Potter and 1 copy of its Chinese translation to thousands of translators and tell them to memorize it and translate a new Harry Potter.",

We created a very, very basic text generation program. Here is the way it worked, which the professor told us was an extremely simplified way AIs generated text. \n\nThe program would receive a massive amount of input via text files. It would take each word and connect it to other words, and weigh the connections. You would pick a starting word and it would spit out a paragraph of text that vaguely resembled the original source. \n\nThe key point in this, in my opinion, is that AIs aren't \"being inspired by\" a work, but are instead taking pieces of work, throwing them into a blender, and spitting them out. I see this less as creation, and more as plagiarization, because an LLM fundamentally cannot create, it can only replicate what it has been given. \n\nIt is also my opinion that AI should not be used to replace creative workers. Using it like Splunk is far better.",

They make claims such as \"if this was about men there'd be no debate\", or \"only women's bodies are regulated\" which is easily disproven. I get it's going for the emotional appeal but it's ignoring reality imo. EVERYONE's body is regulated in some way but when you point it out it's somehow 'different', or justified because xyz, or 'that's not actually bodily autonomy\" or something. The explanations often contradict themselves as well. Tbh while typing this I was about to say making abortion illegal is a violation of bodily autonomy by any definition but then I thought....is it? If I wanted to kill myself and they made it illegal for doctors to administer cyanide, is that violating my bodily autonomy? Anyway that's a different topic for a different day.\n\nMy view is that no one has special privileges to bodily autonomy so there's no reason absolute autonomy is owed to women. I even know for sure what would change my view which is a comment that contains the following:\n\n1. A definition of bodily autonomy. This can either be a your own (reasonable) definition but preferably an official definition from somewhere.\n\n2. Why this definition applies to women/abortions.\n\n3. Why this definition doesn't apply to anything else (note: Yes I think the draft is a violation of bodily autonomy, no I dont' care that it was 50 years ago).\n\nCMV",

Anyway that's a different topic for a different day.\n\nYeah that's the whole assisted dying debate. But I think a lot of proponents of that would say it's about bodily autonomy too. \n\n>1. A definition of bodily autonomy. This can either be a your own (reasonable) definition but preferably an official definition from somewhere.\n\n>2. Why this definition applies to women/abortions.\n\n>3. Why this definition doesn't apply to anything else (note: Yes I think the draft is a violation of bodily autonomy, no I dont' care that it was 50 years ago).\n\nBodily autonomy to me is about making decisions about what happens within your own body. So like abortion, choosing what medical treatment to get etc. even when it's something I personally disagree with, like some people who refuse chemo for whatever reason or tbh even vaccines. I disagree with those decisions and I would say so, but I wouldn't force anyone. Because to me, the right to your own body is one of the most fundamental things there is, if you don't your own body what do you have? \n\nThe common things I see brought up about why \"men have their bodily autonomy violated too\" argument are the draft and circumcisions.\n\nNow with circumcision I absolutely agree that it is a violation of bodily autonomy and shouldn't be done. It's not the same as other medical procedures an adult may consent on behalf of a child for, it's totally unnecessary in most cases. \n\nNow the draft, I disagree that it's about bodily autonomy because it's about freedom of movement. Much like prison. It's not about a choice within your body in the same way. It's still not great, I am anti draft for everyone btw. \n\nAs an extra bit, the whole it was 50 years ago thing gets mentioned because it comes across as very disingenous. If there's a conversation going on about how women right now in this current moment are having their bodily autonomy rolled back, and someone pipes in with \"well the draft is bad for men\" it just feels like a bit of a gotcha, stop complaining moment. Especially when it only gets brought up in this context (maybe I just haven't seen it, but are men out there campaigning to end the draft?) and especially when most men alive haven't even been affected by it and never will be. \n\nBut tbh I'm not really sure what you mean by special privileges, I don't want anyone to have their bodily autonomy violated.",

Guess I phrased it wrong when I asked, because I actually didn't need to. Good for you for being willing, but that was certainly never an important factor here.\n\nLet me put it this way: let's say you eventually have a child, he grows up, and when he hits adulthood, I take his kidney, even though he absolutely does not want to donate his kidney at all, maybe because he's cautious about his personal health, or maybe he's just not comfortable giving his organ to a stranger. Since he supposedly does not have body autonomy, I haven't the slightest reason to honor his concerns, so I'm going to take his kidney anyway. Am I a total jerk for doing it? Maybe. But...something something my life vs his, blah blah. I don't need to justify my actions so the words don't actually matter. In many respects, my actions are almost certainly NOT justified at all. But since he lacks body autonomy, his kidney is mine, sorry! Better luck in your next life, if there even is one, sucker.\n\nWhat I'm demonstrating to you is the exact rationale for why we SHOULD honor body autonomy, regardless of whether we currently do or do not according to the things you're talking about in your OP, working this angle or that. I don't know that it is necessarily *inherent* that we all have body autonomy. But if we chose to adopt the stance that we don't, what I'm talking about here is absolutely 100% on the table. If it horrifies you (and I sincerely hope it does), then that's why we SHOULD favor body autonomy.",

Of course you do not \u201chave a right to X\u201d naturally. We agree on what rights people should have as a society, it is not an unchanging law of physics that if one starts shooting people on the street they would go to jail. It is not an unchanging law of physics that all children go to school. It is not an unchanging law of physics that some areas are smoke free, and others are not smoke free. We just collectively agree that shooting random people is not cool and all children going to school is cool. And smoking is not always cool, but sometimes it is. So saying \u201cyou do not have a right to X\u201d\u2026 like, what does it mean? That you think we shouldn\u2019t have that right? If so, should we have the right to do the opposite (i.e. not being shot is not a right, so we should start promoting shooting random people on the street and put in jail everyone who refuses to participate in this) or that we simply should let everyone decide what they want to do (we can now shoot random people or the street or not, neither choices are punishable)?\u00a0\n\nOr that you think we should have the right, but we do not, and thus \u201cit is not a right\u201d? Or that the right can potentially be taken away and since that is (potentially) possible, it is not a right?\u00a0",

There's no law regulating the practice of circumcision, and I'm not exactly sure how you ask a minutes old baby for approval on the matter.\n\nIn fact, circumcision might be a great example of bodily autonomy in practice. It's an elective procedure that has roots in religious tradition. A Christian nation could easily require circumcisions, much like many North African muslim societies require both male and female circumcisions at birth. But America allows the freedom of choice.",

        "text": "Bodily autonomy to me means you and you alone control your health decisions, your lifestyle, and sometimes how you want to die if you become seriously ill.\n\nAbortion is an emotional wedge issue that Republicans have used to gain power. Rich millionaire senators and representatives have paid for plenty of abortions for their mistresses and wives and girlfriends or whoever else. A large percentage of Republicans in Congress are millionaires and they are looking out for their own best interests and not the American people's best interest...because of that they have no real base. They have no policies that will help the lives of ordinary people, so they create these emotional issues to rile up a base for themselves. Such as who uses what bathrooms, building a border wall, using fear tactics like you're going to lose your job because some uneducated Mexican we can't speak English might take your job. Abortion motivates their base to vote for them even if it's not in their best interest economically. That's why blue collar Americans who are barely scraping by will vote for people who will raise their taxes on ordinary people and lower taxes for themselves.\n\nBesides that whole mess, another issue is that people don't agree on what the facts are. One side thinks you have an independent little baby inside a mother, and performing an abortion is killing a human baby. The other side thinks it's a private medical decision that a woman has to make for yourself without the involvement of the government, and a fetus up to a certain point in time is not a viable baby and can be aborted. Since they don't agree on what it's actually going on and what an abortion actually does they're never going to agree on anything.\n\nWhy isn't this argument used for anything else? I think  assisted suicide falls under bodily autonomy in a similar way, and at times in the not so distant past people got worked up about it almost the same way they get upset about abortion.",

I don't think anyone makes the claim that only women should have autonomy over their body. They are just a group that tends to have this taken from them. Allowing Abortions allows women to make an informed decision that directly affects their life and body forever. This isn't a temporary change. This is a life affecting decision that should have all options available. I hope you'd agree that if you had magically gotten pregnant that you'd want to be given a choice over your potential career path and a child you may or may not want.\n\nYes, I think the potential father involved should have a say. However, ultimately taking care of the child falls to the mother primarily; whether you agree or not, this is true and expected in modern society. Therefore, if men can take a backseat on raising their child, the woman should have the final say on keeping said child. No one wants massive responsibility forced on them.\n\nI can only hope and assume I don't have to justify abortion for rape victims - I hope you've considered this in your opinion.\n\nWhether autonomy should be applied to other things is a separate conversion. However, I can not imagine that you'd come across many people who are pro choice and are against assisted suicide or decriminalising drugs, etc..if these people exist, then I agree those individuals are holding a double standard. So, in short, I think bodily autonomy should be applied to those things.",

        "text": "Let's talk about bodily autonomy from a purely legal perspective, since that seems to be what you're looking for. The Supreme Court has consistently defined it as \"the right to make decisions about one's own body without external interference or coercion\" (McFall v. Shimp, 1978).\n\nHere's why this matters: No law can force you to donate blood or organs to save someone else's life - even after you're dead! I can't be forced to give up my kidney even if my own child needs it to survive. This is a fundamental legal principle that applies regardless of gender.\n\nThe key difference with abortion is that it's about NOT using your body to support another potential life. It's like refusing to donate an organ - you're not killing anyone, you're just not offering your body's resources.\n\nThe draft comparison doesn't work because it's about state power during extreme national emergencies. It's like how the government can quarantine people during a pandemic - it's a completely different legal framework based on compelling state interest.\n\nI'm actually pretty moderate on this issue, but the legal precedent is clear: you can't force someone to use their body to keep another person alive. Whether it's a fetus or a dying patient needing a blood transfusion, that's the consistent principle that courts have upheld for decades.\n\nThe real question isn't about special privileges - it's about maintaining the same standard of bodily autonomy that already exists in every other area of American law.",

Similar to yelling \u201cfire\u201d in a theater.\n\n2. Whether this applies to women seems to hinge on if you think a fetus is an autonomous person. Scientifically it really isn\u2019t, as it wouldn\u2019t survive outside the womb - but even then, in late term a fetus being almost born is close to a baby, so that\u2019s why MOST do not unconditionally condone late-term abortions unless there\u2019s a serious malady that the fetus won\u2019t survive and/or will threaten the mother\u2019s life. Despite what republicans have said, people are not aborting babies after they are born (murder). \n\n3. It does apply to anything else. No one is forcing you to get a vasectomy, right? That\u2019s because you have your own choice in the matter. If you cut your arm and it became infected, no one would tell you not to treat it because of some law. No hospital would turn you away because of threats of jail time. For instances where a mother\u2019s life is threatened, especially where the fetus will already not survive, that choice is being taken from them. Several women have died in abortion-ban states because doctors will not do reproductive care until sepsis, a dangerous state. \n\nThat\u2019s for extreme examples. But the choice to have more average elective abortions, especially early on, is being restricted as well. An embryo is not a living human being, neither is a zygote. So the choice to remove that from a woman\u2019s body should be entirely up to the woman, the same way people make choices about their body all the time.",

Most people understand that their bodily autonomy ends when other people's bodily autonomy begins. \n\nTo illustrate this, I'll use two examples discussed in the comments, abortions and vaccinations. \n\nThe difference in regard to bodily autonomy is that while abortions don't spread from person to person, being unvaccinated can potentially put others at risk. The obvious counter argument is that abortions impact fetuses, other then mothers. But many people do not consider a fetus an \"autonomous\" person, as it's entirely dependent on the body it is in, and therefore cannot claim bodily autonomy up until a certain point. \n\nThat leads to a broader consideration: the social contract we all implicitly share, requires the suspension of bodily autonomy in some instances for it to work: work, the justice system, the draft, etc. \n\nWhen intersubjectively agree that there's a common interest in doing so, we supersede bodily autonomy. One could argue that the necessity to sell your time and parts of your body, to earn money and eat is in some way a coercion, a violation of bodily autonomy, but we recognize that it's the way our society functions and we can't just avoid it in name of absolute autonomy. Same goes for your example, the draft: the nation needs to defend itself requires the suspension of bodily autonomy rights when needed, under the notion that defending our society as a system is more important than defending people's right to bodily autonomy, and we deemed a suspension of it as acceptable. If that sentiment change and traduces itself in effective political action, that could change. \n\nIn a similar way, some argue that abortions should be banned because population is getting old and as a society it's in our best interest to have more babies, and that common interest should supersede individual's rights. If that sentiment spreads enough, the laws will change. Same goes for UBI, the draft, etc. Politics is the way we collectively decide how bodily autonomy is managed.",

Because the doctor may assess the risk of injury if it passes naturally is lower than if they remove it.\n\nSo let's say that passing it naturally incurs significant health risks, and removing it is incredibly easy and safe. In that case the doctor would be obligated to remove it.\n\nSo therefore, as part of my package of rights covering healthcare (the right to healthcare, the right to informed consent etc.), I have the right to have the object removed.\n\nNow you can probably see how this translates to abortion. Giving birth is still medically dangerous for both parent and child, and abortion carries little to no major health risks.\n\nTherefore, the right to bodily autonomy (or rather in the UK, the constellation of rights surrounding healthcare and medical consent) absolutely cover abortion. \n\nIn fact, the even more fundamental argument, except in the US which is bananas, is not whether women have a right to have an abortion, but rather whether a woman has the right to consult a doctor about getting a voluntary abortion. As I've shown, that is explicitly a right, even without my little analogy.\n\nEqually important to consider is the alternative to the above analogy where someone has inserted an object into me without my consent. Which I think makes the conclusion even more clear.\n\nFinally, I know the moral question of the \"third party\" in this medical situation has been left unaddressed, but I personally don't believe that embryos can be considered parties with the ability to consent until very late in their development. At what point they can be, is up to doctors who no more about human development than me.",

    "text": "Just to be clear. This does not apply for all moderators. I know some moderators on small Subreddits that are really good people. Speaking for a lot of larger Subreddits where moderation is an issue.\n\nReddit has a moderator problem. They can do a lot of things to you that doesn't really make lots of sense, and they do not give you a reason for it. More often than not, you're just muted from speaking with the moderator. Unfortunately, due to a lot of Reddit mods and Redditors in general being left-wing, there are a lot of examples of right-wingers being the victims. Such as this one on the r/ medicine Subreddit. He got deleted for asking questions. A person said Trump's NIH nomination caused \"large scale needless death\". When he was asked what the large scale death in question was, his comment was deleted by the mods. Along with a person being perm banned for saying \"orange man bad. Laugh at joke. Unga Bunga\" in r/ comics. The most notable case of moderation abuse is from r/ pics, where they just ban you for participating in a \"bad faith Subreddit\". Even if you just commented.\n\nThis is not a good thing. It means that if you want to participate in a major Subreddit with a lot of people, you will have to conform to what the moderators personally see as \"correct\" or \"good\". This doesn't foster productive conversations, nor is it good for anybody but the moderator's egos. I understand if this is the case in small Subreddits, but the examples I listed above aren't they happen in Subreddits with 30+ million members that regularly hit the front page. This is Reddit being lazy and offloading moderation.  Most moderators do this for power and control. The nature of this position (no pay) means that the only other thing it offers is power. Especially in Subreddits with millions of people, that's a lot of power. This I believe is a reason it isn't a major issue in small servers. The mods there are genuinely passionate because that is the only thing going for them in a Subreddit with around a thousand people. Even Twitter, despite its multitude of issues, does moderation better than this",

As a leftist, I have been banned from many subreddits you would probably call liberal and similarly there are a litany of outright conservative subs that will ban you if you even remotely imply questioning the right wing media machine.\n\nI think the main problem with the subreddit moderation is how it intersects with the reddit admin. Getting banned from a sub is one thing. But the fact that messaging the mods about it can lead to a harassment strike or that going there in good faith with an alt can get you banned from reddit as a whole pretty easily is ridiculous. I also do think there should at least be *some* oversight on mods so that they at least are required to state their rules very clearly. The rules themselves can be arbitrary but it should be easy enough for a user to know if they are breaking one rather than just the mods handing out baseless bans on a whim. I also think permabans should not be allowed for a \u201cfirst offense.\u201d",

Not a perfect analogy, because subs are more like businesses in that they are open to the public, but even there we have tightly enforced rules of behavior depending on the business. You will be removed if you go to a play and begin arguing with the actors mid-performance. You will be removed if you go to a restaurant and try to let yourself into the kitchen. The solution is simple: start your own sub that you own, and moderate it however you like. If you feel people should be able to argue with the actors or cook their own meal, then start a business like that. \n\nWhat you will find is that building a successful sub, attracting members, keeping it on-topic, and defending it from trolls is a hard, thankless, unpaid job. At some level you must know this, it's why you want to take a shortcut and help yourself to the platform someone else has built rather than taking the enormous investment of time and effort to create your own community based on your principles. \n\nIf every platform has to be open to every comment from every internet user, there would be no point in separate subs. Every sub would degenerate into a soapbox for those with the most free time to shout their pet views into the void.",

The justification made was that being pro-Ukraine made you anti-Libertarian or something like that. And I know that others have tons of similar examples.\n\nI think overall, getting perma-banned without real cause is unfortunately part of the reddit experience, and I'm not really sure how to fix it as reddit leaves it almost entirely up to the subs to police their own slice of the site. In practice, Reddit skews a bit to the left politically, so you see examples of this most often from left-leaning subs, but in my experience it's basically just as common in the right-leaning subs.\n\nSo I suppose I'm not trying to change your mind that reddit has a moderator problem, but I am trying to change your mind that this is a problem linked to left-wing politics.

        "text": "I want to change your view in one specific aspect\n\n> Most moderators do it for power and control\n\nI want you to put yourself in the shoes of a moderator, especially for a large subreddit. Keep in mind that you have a fulltime job, and other responsibilities in life. This moderator thing is, technically, a hobby for you, because it's something you do in your free time that you aren't getting paid for.\n\nNow, the subreddit you moderate is quite large. That means hundreds, or thousands, of reports coming in, probably your own Automod is flagging hundreds of items for you to look at, dozens to hundreds of people messaging you with questions, complaints, abuse, requests, etc. Your inbox is a never-ending list of shit to do.\n\nNow, try to imagine this: how much time and attention could you allocate for one specific issue? What about the one after that? Day in, day out, what do you think will be the average amount of time/attention/effort you can spare on any individual item, knowing there are hundreds or thousands more waiting for you to deal with?\n\nIn your post, you mentioned that \"this is Reddit offloading its moderation responsibilities\". You are 100% right. Online moderation is a difficult job, even when you're actually being paid for it. It's easy to mess up, in any number of ways. And the result of messing up is, you've caused an unfair outcome for someone. And you probably cause dozens to hundreds of these per month at a *minimum*, because how much time do you really have to evaluate each issue with *perfect* fairness and nuance?\n\nAs a moderator, it's *easy* to just say \"hey automod. remove comments from any user who was active in one of these subreddits\". It saves you time. The alternative is an incredible amount of more work for you.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who has, unfortunately, had multiple instances of joining a cool new subreddit, and getting all my comments removed because one of the subreddits I commented in one time turned out to be a Bad Subreddit. It sucks. But at the end of the day, the issue is not with the moderators, it is with the structure of this whole system. It does not scale. And because moderation *has* to have a human element (yes, it really, *really* does), I don't see how it *can* scale, unless more people start becoming moderators. Which, I don't know about you, but being a moderator does *not* sound appealing to me.",

Alexander, Genghis Khan, Napoleon (I disagree with your view of Stalin though) were loved during their lifetimes, immediately afterwards, and continue to be today. Hitler,\u00a0 on the other hand, is hated by the vast majority of Germans today and their education system and culture as a whole ensures people know the horrors he caused.\u00a0While one day, Hitler might be viewed in a less negative light, I think it likely will be from most of the world moving on from the suffering he caused, not Germany specifically wanting to praise him.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, he was a pretty bad military leader, unlike the other examples you mentioned. Germany did well when the generals were allowed to run the army, once Hitler tried to take over, things went very poorly. I doubt people will want to celebrate his military achievements, even if they ate interested in the Nazi takeover of Europe.\u00a0",

He experienced Hitler's reign firsthand and even fought the Russians when Germany was on its knees to avoid falling into captivity. One of the first books I read was \"Wenn Hitler den Krieg gewonnen h\u00e4tte\" (What if Hitler won the war) and reading stories of 10y olds being military objects that threw grenades or piloted jets fascinated me. I never felt any pride though. It just seemed surreal. \n\nWe learned about Nazi Germany in school for years and across multiple subjects. I still speak with my children about the war every now and then because their granddad was a US GI stationed in Bremerhaven about 15y after the war and the children are half German, half US citizens. They then went to school in Germany so they know our history as well.\n\nIn addition there's the European Union now which lasts for almost 30y and strongly tightens the relationships between its members, e.g. by erasing borders and enabling an easier exchange of people, money and goods. While Europe will still be a region of nations in 100y I doubt we will lean that much out of the window to past for warlords.\n\nWill this sentiment stick? Nobody knows. But I feel like it's deeply ingrained into us and Nationalsocialist tendencies will be met forever with critique.",

    "text": "As a preface to this - I am not necessarily an anti-vaccine advocate and I am vaccinated against COVID19. \n\nI've been thinking a lot about the necessity of the COVID-19 vaccine and whether it was as crucial as it was made out to be. Looking at the data from countries with very low vaccination rates, such as Haiti, Burundi, and Yemen, it seems like these places haven't experienced the same level of chaos as more vaccinated countries like the United States. \n\n1. **Haiti**: Despite a vaccination rate of just 3.6%, Haiti has reported relatively low numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths.[ With a population of over 11 million, they have recorded only about 34,667 cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Haiti) and [860 deaths](https://sehhty.com/en/ht-covid/)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Haiti)This suggests that even with minimal vaccination efforts, the impact has been contained.\n2. **Burundi**: This country has one of the lowest vaccination rates globally, yet it reported only[ 54,569 cases and 15 deaths as of late 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Burundi)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Burundi)\n3. **Yemen**: Although Yemen has faced significant challenges due to conflict and a fragile healthcare system, its COVID-19 case numbers remain relatively low compared to global figures. [The case fatality rate was high at certain points, but overall incidence rates were not overwhelming](https://sehhty.com/en/ye-covid/)[](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-024-09650-0)\n\n# In contrast, the United States has a high vaccination rate but also reported over[ 111 million cases and more than 1.2 million deaths](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States)Despite extensive vaccination campaigns, the U.S. experienced severe waves of infection and high mortality rates.\n\n# I completely acknowledge that lower testing rates in countries like Haiti and Burundi lead to underreporting of cases. However, if COVID-19 were truly running amok, we would expect to see more indirect indicators of healthcare strain or excess mortality. Alternatively we would be seeing more lockdowns or alternative ways of dealing with the pandemic in those countries. \n\n  \nThings that could change my mind:   \nStatistics that show that there is a correlation between countries with low vaccination and covid mortality on a curve (not cherry picking specific countries).   \nExamples that show that countries today with low vaccination rates are still locked down or severely impacted from COVID. \n\nBut I was unable to find either - if you have other ways to change my mind, please try so. I would like not to be become an anti-vaccine advocate, but the things I have found is making me question the extent to which people blindly tout them as the solution rather than a solution. \n\n",

        "text": "It is better to compare cohorts of people in similar countries or the same country. One of the best analysis relevant to what you are wondering is to look at how the death rate of persons in a particular country change. Here is the finding:\n\n1. The death rates decreased FOR ALL cohorts (that is, persons who are vaccinated, partially vaccinated, or not vaccinated) when the vaccines were introduced.\n\n2. The death rates decreased THE MOST for those who are fully vaccinated and THE LEAST for those who are unvaccinated. But the death rate did not reach zero for any.\n\nThis relation was found in several countries (e.g. USA, Switzerland, Chile). See this site for data and extended argument: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination)\n\nHere is how you can reconcile this: infectious disease moves from one infected person to another uninfected person. When some number of people in the population become immune or partially immune thanks to vaccine or natural immunity after recovery from an infection, then there are fewer people who can transmit the disease. Hence, everyone benefits. Those who take the vaccine help themselves and their fellow citizens.\n\nYour view states the vaccines were not necessary to lift lockdowns. In a strict sense, this is true. After a sufficient number of people have been infected (and the weakest perished), then natural immunity will happen. The COVID pandemic was not the first pandemic and back when the Spanish Flu happened, there were no vaccines to talk of. \n\nSo the choice we had was how to return to normal. The rapid development and deployment of vaccines to a majority of the population had benefits in that it meant fewer deaths, and fewer people having to be put on a ventilator, which is unpleasant. Nowadays lockdowns are rarely if ever needed because a sufficient number of people are immune to covid (and indirectly, the virus has mutated to become less lethal).\n\nYou point to other countries that did not have the option to use advanced vaccines. As others have noted many of these countries have younger populations. Young people were far less affected by COVID. Also, hot countries where most labour and social activities take place outdoors are less affected because the virus spreads more easily indoors. \n\nI think your view should be changed to: Vaccination against COVID-19 of a large enough group of persons in a society, especially one that skews towards older persons, was the preferable way to return to mostly normal social and economic activities.\n\nA final note: our ability to attribute what social issues were a direct effect of COVID, the virus, and what effects arose from our actions (e.g. lockdown, government handouts, school closures) are going to be hard to disentangle. I think we can be critical of aspects of what happened during the pandemic. Some countries are worse off after the pandemic than others. But it is far more likely to be a consequence of other acts taken. The vaccines reduced population death rates, which is very helpful.",

Those numbers are simply the best that can be gathered in such places. Extrapolating that to any other nation is plainly wrong and ignores all context. Getting true accurate data on vaccination rates or deaths related to any disease is difficult in a modern Western nation. \n\nSecondly, what you have stated in the \"things that will change my mind\" section is data that simply does not exist, because countries with low vaccination rates are those with poor infrastructure, limited health care and little government oversight. That does not make your view accurate or the most logical conclusion. It makes it a correlation equals causation conclusion. \n\nThirdly, COVID isn't a super deadly disease. It really only a serious threat to the elderly, most of whom will survive an infection, but the rate of death will be higher. Or the immune compromised or very young. Equally in Haiti, Yemen and Burundi, their populations are on average much younger than western nations.",

The difficulty was that some side effects were so rare as to only be evident when huge amounts of doses were used. No amount of trials would have been feasible for that. Luckily it *has* been closely monitored ever since which is why we know the incident rate and severity of side effects. And we know the efficacy. Which tells us it\u2019s safer than unvaccinated covid. While the risk from covid in certain age groups is now known to be extremely low and the risk from the vaccine known to be slightly higher for some demographics (depending on which one they use) , I\u2019ve yet to see any research that shows the risk of the latter is higher than that of the former in any demographic. The side effects tend to be mild and self-correcting in most affected.",

However, COVID-19 is much more dangerous for older people who are abundant in the US and rare in these three places. 17.3% of Americans are over the age of 65 but only 2.8 and 3 percent of Burundians and Yemenis are.

We've done nothing but ostracize Russia since the fall of the USSR, when they were very willing to work and compromise with us. Did u know gorbachev and yeltsin both asked to join NATO? They were largely ignored and assured NATO wouldn't expand. That was russias main ask, not to extend NATO past Germany after agreeing to withdrawl from east Germany and allow it to reunify. We'll, we did and we got Putin. Not apologizing for his invasion, but russia didn't wake up one day in 2022 and was like, hmm let's invade ukraine for no reason whatsoever other than I'm Hitler 2.0",

Some non-representative politicians certainly did, but that's a given for every possible statement under the sun.\n\n>Not apologizing for his invasion, but russia didn't wake up one day in 2022 and was like, hmm let's invade ukraine for no reason whatsoever other than I'm Hitler 2.0\n\nYes, first they invaded Hungary after it withdrew from the Warsaw Pact, then Czechoslovakia, then Georgia, then Crimea, and now the rest of Ukraine. This isn't the sort of pattern of behavior that would be highly alarming to its neighbors and make them seek a defensive pact, not at all!",

Reality is, if Putin would withdraw, there is nonzero chance that an actual Hitler comes to power and starts a nuclear war. So, propaganda helped him to hold power and convince a population that a war is necessary while simultaneously burned the bridges behind.\n\nAlthough, this is only true if Russian propaganda actually works. Most probably it actually does not, populations still wants a peaceful resolution despite hateful rhetoric, at least that's what the polls show.",

None of the Russian political class would. They aren't stupid. Medvedev is constantly out there making the biggest threats not because he sincerely means it, but because Russia stands to gain a lot if we in the west believe they're on the brink of launching nukes. They never stand to gain anything from actually pressing the button, only from threats of doing so.",

The Soviet Union collapsed without triggering WWIII, and today's Russia is far weaker.\n\nLook at the actual facts: Russia can barely maintain control over parts of Ukraine despite throwing everything they have at it. Their military is depleted, using North Korean ammunition and Iranian drones because they can't produce enough themselves. Their \"stern warnings\" are just bluster - they've been threatening nuclear war over Finland joining NATO, Western tanks in Ukraine, etc. None of it materialized.\n\nChina isn't going to risk their $18 trillion economy and trade relationships for Putin's failing adventure. They're actually scaling back support - just look at how they're enforcing sanctions on microchips now.\n\n> Russians can't back down. If Putin dies, a similar person will take his place.\n\nThis is historically false. When strongmen fail catastrophically, they're usually replaced by reformers - look at Stalin->Khrushchev or Franco->Juan Carlos. Putin's successor will likely blame him for Russia's decline and pivot to reconstruction.\n\nThe current situation actually resembles the late 1980s USSR - a failing state trying to maintain an image of strength while crumbling internally. And just like then, the most likely outcome is internal collapse followed by a messy but ultimately non-violent transition.\n\nReal wars happen when both sides think they can win. Russia knows they can't win against NATO. They'll keep posturing and causing trouble, but that's very different from risking total destruction in WWIII.",

They don't want russia gone, because it plays the role of \"chaotic\" antagonist, where western politicians can \"point\" to keep their voters distracted and in tension to maintain \"control\" and have their lives the usual way.\n\nOn the other hand, where does all the children's of russian \"elites\" go? And themselves too? Not to the pioneer camp \"Oktyabryanok\", no. They go study in european/us universities, live luxurious lifes abroad, travel, make instagram content. And, what, they're gonna bomb them? Or tell them to go back because \"we need to trade our luxury lifes for waaaar\"?\n\nI cannot give full thought through argument for this, but stumbling sometimes on a slip like \"of course, even in this antagonizing time we maintain some contact\", it makes me think - russia, china, us, european conglomerate, different cultures, nations, ideologies, methods, BUT! Unified human nature and so, motivation, for any politicians or other element with **power**. \n\nAnd i do believe \"their\" goals and motivations are very different from ours, but very standard and understandable among themselves. So, direct war in Ukraine with few \"calls\" and then rely on classic \"we are law, law says so, you don't abide the laaaaaw????\" - why not. We have already seen several instances of \"West\" and russia playing along.\n\nAs a Ukrainian, i will say two things.\n\nWe will remember hospitality of european **people**.\n\nWe will remember ugliness, cynics, moral bankruptcy ans lies, lies, lies of western politicians.",

A new Russian leader with a similar personality and image to Putin (which is by no means guaranteed) would have the ability to say \"this war was Putin's folly, Russians are brothers with Ukrainians, we should never fight them\" and call the warmongers the new enemy to root out who bankrupted Russia.

What irrational things they have done?\n\n>I can remember the same people saying at the start of this invasion \"Russia will never invade, that is just stupid\" now saying that \"Russia will never escalate this war, that is just stupid\".\n\nIf they are the same people, they are simply misinformed. Anyone who at the start of the invasion were thinking that \"Russia will never invade\" was simply ignoring the rationality of it. Putin knew there is a high chance that they will storm Kiev in few days, install a puppet government and everyone will slap some half-assed sanctions until it's again business as usual.\n\nAnd that was not an irrational decision - it was logical one based off data about military strength if RU & UA and attitudes of UA possible allies. And it worked exactly like that - in beginning there was outcry without much action, which only started after it was shown that UA stands and did not fall. This is where this war started to turn sour for Russia.\n\nAnd the mistake was because of abysmal state of Russian military hidden under pile of fake bureaucratic documents. Not even Russia knew how crap their army is.\n\nNow, the escalation into WW3 is a truly irrational one. First, it is shown that UA army is able to hold back RU army only with limited supply from allies - so who will Russia fight with without being steamrolled? Second is the nuke situation - considering the difference of RU army on paper and in reality, what is the chance that nukes fare much better? They have even more places to easily hide defrauding the funds as they are even less expected to be used compared to army. Third is geopolitics - World War requires at least two blocks of countries facing each other in different parts of the world. Who will fight on Russian side? China will not, as they have their own problems with Russia and are partners of convenience, not allies. And without China, who can support Russia to escalate this to WW3? \n\nAs for Russian population - they are irrelevant. It's an autocratic country and if decisions is made, they will be taught the new version of reality. Not like it would be the first time.",

        "text": "You just don't understand what the situation in Ukraine is about.\n\nrussia has barely enough resources to fight in Ukraine - they lost most of their materiel in first months of the war, their economy is ravaged by sanctions and protectionism. But they have a lot of peoples they don't think they need. Yeah, all those 'non-titular nation' peoples. So they can 'liberate' Ukrainian territory by fertilizing it's soil with their remains.\n\nUkraine, on the other hand, doesn't have any luxury of having their people suicide for battlefield gains. As to materiel, russian agents and local idiots had 30 years to successfully mishandle Ukraine's economy in general and military-industrial complex in particular, so now Ukrainians have to rely on foreign materiel aid A LOT.\n\nAnd while Ukrainians are thankful to their donors for that materiel aid, said donors seem to drip-feed that aid, their motivation being either 'we don't think you need what you ask' or 'we are afraid what you ask may lead to more people dying'. \n\nThose are motivations they are talking about. What they are not talking about is, US, UK, Germany and most other donors have their military-industrial complex bloating from all the new contracts and they are getting Russia weaker with every day of the war and punitive sanctions. Yes, they could help Ukrainians more by lifting certain limits on use of their weapons, but also not having their supply stopped arbitrarily like they did last year.\n\n'But what about russian nukes and WW3 being nuclear?' you would say. I would say, russia would gain nothing but problems by using any nuclear armament. Nukes are not weapons you fight war with - they are for when you want to really destroy some place, make it uninhabitable, they are strategic weapon, not a tactical one. And let me remind you, that wars (for now) are fought by people, not weapons. If you can't back up the strategic advantage created by nuclear strike with tactical maneuvering your troops to achieve your goals in the conflict, especially if you don't have the troops, then that strategic advantage is nonexistent. So yeah, nukes won't change the fact that russia doesn't have economy, materiel or personnel to do anything against those they say they fight against in Ukraine (US and NATO).\n\nNow, my personal conspiracy is that donor countries drip-feed the aid they provide to Ukraine in a way to 'slowly boil the russian frog'. They use Ukraine's will to live to destroy russian people and economy. Any way to achieve a lasting peace would be detrimental to their goal of destroying russia.\n\nStill, I think the question of possibility of hot WW3 is still on the table, just not with russia but with China or Iran. If you had argument about them and not russia I might have even agreed with you.",

    "text": "Marriage isn\u2019t just about love; it\u2019s also a legal agreement regulated by the government. When you get married, you get a government-issued marriage license, which essentially makes it a formal contract between two people. So, if someone cheats (without consent), isn\u2019t that a clear breach of the agreement? And if contracts in business or other legal contexts come with penalties when broken, why not this one too?\n\nHere\u2019s my view: adultery should be treated as fraud or deceit, not just a personal issue. If one partner cheats, there should be tangible, government-enforced consequences - like fines or losing alimony rights. This wouldn\u2019t make cheating a criminal offense, but it would acknowledge the harm caused and hold the cheater accountable. Right now, the cheated-on spouse often suffers emotionally *and* financially (if they choose to start divorce proceedings), while the cheater faces no real repercussions. That\u2019s just unfair.\n\nIf the government is involved in the marriage process from the start, issuing licenses and all that, why shouldn\u2019t they also enforce penalties for breaching this contract? It\u2019s not about moral policing; it\u2019s about fairness and accountability.\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t adultery have legal consequences like other forms of fraud?",

With \"no fault\" divorces the norm, the implied consequence, you losing your partner, is less legally important since you can start divorce proceedings without it.\n\nThere's nothing stopping you, specifically, from entering into a prenup that would have an enforceable penalty on either party thats triggered by infidelity, so I guess my question is why would you want to push marriage reform through for this specific issue?",

What qualifies as neglect? Who determines it? The person feeling neglected might believe they are being neglected, but that perception doesn\u2019t necessarily align with the perspective of the supposed neglector.\n\nIn this case, we\u2019re discussing two functioning adults. If Person A feels neglected, there\u2019s time to address the issue through communication or by leaving a potentially harmful situation. Cheating, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t offer that same opportunity. It directly and immediately causes emotional harm.\n\nOf course, we're not talking about \"loverboy\" scenarios or similar coercive situations here, as those are punishable by law (at least where I\u2019m from). And i understand the emotional severity of having to leave a person you care about. They should receive any mental support they can that helps them understand that they should leave. But you cant auto blame that one the supposed negelector.\n\nThe only way i see this work if the marriage contract contains certain clear guidelines like idk: minimum 10 hugs a week, no bad faith badmouthing, 2 dates a month, equal amounts of cleaning and dishes, having to watch eachothers terribly boring tv shows without bitch and moaning, and be invested enough to understand what is going on.

You can hug someone 10 times in a row out of obligation and there wouldn't be any emotion there, you can go on dates where you just kinda sit in silence, and you can watch twilight and just have it build emotional resentment because you were woken up at one in the freaking morning to watch twilight. But according to the courts this would be a strong marriage because they're following all the rules.",

It May be reasonable to be spending too much time away from home. It MAY be reasonable to be angry if you're going through behavior altering mental health episodes.

But I think that sex is the most benign form of cheating. \n\nI would not consider it cheating if my partner kissed her best friend while drunk during a party game. I would consider it cheating if she went on dates with someone for months, even if they never physically touched. What about someone that got drunk, and went home with someone else, but you caught them before they ever actually did anything? \n\nIt would be very easy to flag the first as cheating but to ignore the second, and the third probably isn't cheating on a technicality. \n\nSure, you could create a rule that means that you can never fuck another person; otherwise, your marriage immediately ends, but I just don't see the value in that.",

What that looks like to each person is different; some people might not be as this or that, but it matters that you all you have to give to the person you share your life with. \n\n>Also I think there's a misunderstanding here. I don't think OP said cheating is the ONLY thing that should be punished\u00a0\n\nI agree, they didn't. However, my view is that nothing should be punished. \n\nLet me be clear. Sleeping with people, emotional neglect, or anything else is a perfectly valid reason to end a marriage. And you then lose all the benefits of being married. \n\nHowever, it should not change what you come out of your marriage with. Everything in the marriage was built together, and so everything belongs to both parties and should be split accordingly.",

You also don't lose future benefits such as your pension. \n\nIf your marriage ends for gross misconduct, for example, you cheat, your marriage should end - which it does. Your partner can file for divorce. \n\nWhat I don't think should happen is that you should lose any of your rights around your divorce. You are still entitled to half of the life that you build with your partner  - because you built it together. I cannot stand it when people talk about their partner \"taking half their money\" in a divorce. It is both of yours. That is what the contract of marriage means: everything you built, you built together. The same applies to alimony. Alimony is most often awarded as an acknowledgement that one partner gave up their capacity to earn in a marriage (for example, by taking on the childcare duties) and is them being compensated for that. I don't believe that that changes just because your contract has now ended. \n\nGiven the above being my actual point, I want to give some reasons why, even if you did think some things should be a 'breach of contract', adultery is not as clear cut a limit as people have made out.",

It's not just what's in the bank today. It's what you make next week and every week after until the person remarries. You're discounting the agency of the offending party. If they are so wholly dependent on their partner to survive then MAYBE they should think twice about cheating. \n\nAdultery is as clear of an example as you'll get in breach of contract for marriage. Objectively it is probably the only thing that is black and white. It either happened and there's proof/admission or it didn't.\n\nArguing emotional abuse is purely subjective and would be far more difficult to enforce.",

Why should risking your partners health via an STI be treated differently to risking their health another way? \n\nI also assume that the health risk isn\u2019t the only reason why you don\u2019t think people should cheat in a marriage, so we could assume for sake of argument that the health risks are fully mitigated. Zero risk. Do you still think cheating should result in asset forfeiture?",

Poor performance is grounds for dismissal because anything outside of a narrowly defined set protections is grounds for dismissal, and no reason has to be given at all.

An employer could put definitive performance targets in an employment agreement. They almost never do though, because being able to nebulously say that an employee wasn\u2019t meeting expectations without having to really explain what that means gives employers protection from potential discrimination cases that could be brought against them. \n\nSo is it possible? Yes. But it would be dumb on an employer\u2019s part to so clearly write down the expectations required to be a good worker in a legal document.",

When you get married, you get a government-issued marriage license, which essentially makes it a formal contract between two people. So, if someone cheats (without consent), isn\u2019t that a clear breach of the agreement? And if contracts in business or other legal contexts come with penalties when broken, why not this one too?\n\n>Here\u2019s my view: adultery should be treated as fraud or deceit, not just a personal issue. If one partner cheats, there should be tangible, government-enforced consequences - like fines or losing alimony rights. This wouldn\u2019t make cheating a criminal offense, but it would acknowledge the harm caused and hold the cheater accountable. Right now, the cheated-on spouse often suffers emotionally *and* financially (if they choose to start divorce proceedings), while the cheater faces no real repercussions. That\u2019s just unfair.\n\n>If the government is involved in the marriage process from the start, issuing licenses and all that, why shouldn\u2019t they also enforce penalties for breaching this contract? It\u2019s not about moral policing; it\u2019s about fairness and accountability.\n\n>Why shouldn\u2019t adultery have legal consequences like other forms of fraud?\n\nnone of those paragraphs explicitly mention prenups.",

Couples fight all the time and say things they don't mean.\n\nCheating? Not something I've done and can't empathise. Must be the worst thing in the world.\n\nObviously these aren't the exact thoughts that go through people's heads, I'm just saying the closer you are to being able to empathise with the behaviour, the less likely you'll see it deserving a severe punishment.",

If you've been in a relationship for literally decades you probably own a home together, have kids together, and have every aspect of your personal and financial life intertwined with the other person.

According to B, A was very emotionally manipulative throughout the relationship. B considered leaving several times, but A threatened B with committing suicide if she did, and B ended up backpedaling every time. Eventually B cheated on A.\n\nDo you think that in these case Partner B deserves to be punished for cheating when she tried to leave the relationship earlier several times, but was prevented from doing so by B by way of emotional manipulation?",

If severe mental health episodes are making you bad to be around. Or perhaps a partner not even knowing they're being a bad partner.\u00a0\n\n\nCheating is a very clear, very out of your way to hurt someone. Especially if you let the problems in your relationship compound and not address them until you cheated. It takes two to keep a bad relationship going, it takes one to cheat.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso the \"cheater-defenders\" for a lack of a better term here, keep going to the extremes of the arguments rather than what's most common. If someone is an ok partner but the other partner still cheats is THAT a breach of contract worth penalizing?

Some people might be incredibly frustrated by a dead bedroom or a distant spouse, others might not care all that much. The same goes for cheating; being cheated on is shitty for sure, but it doesn't always cause huge emotional damage. Maybe the spouse already checked out of the relationship themselves and don't care all that much. I've seen it happen in the real world.\n\nAnd no, not everyone who cheats is doing so with the express purpose of hurting their spouse. And neither is cheating always the very worst thing that you can do to a person. For example, I'd argue that gambling away your shared life savings can have a way more significant impact on the rest of your spouse's life. \n\nI'm not 'defending cheating' in any way and it's kind of annoying how people resort to saying that to score some quick points. I'm merely saying that punishing cheating alone with financial penalties while not punishing any other kind of emotionally damaging behaviour in a marriage is rather arbitrary.\n\n>Because if not, then you're arguing that no fault divorce should be the only acceptable way to have a divorce happen, am I right?\n\nYes. I don't believe that the government should get to decide what is and isn't ethical behaviour in a relationship. If individuals do want to define it explicitly, they can set up a contract themselves, there's no need to make it mandatory. I also don't think that you can get an all-encompassing legal definition for what is and isn't 'cheating' that most people will agree with in the first place. No-fault divorce is the only option in my country.",

So you can include monogamy vows if you want, you can include emotionally respectful vows if you want, whatever.\n\nIf you want to involve the law in determining fault, then you can also make those vows *written down*. You can get a pre-nup. And then you can, as above, include the monogamy vows if you want, *or the emotionally respectful vows*, or whatever, and you can lay out the penalties for what happens if those vows are broken.\n\nIn other words, it's totally viable for what OP is asking for, people just have to decide to do it. But if people don't decide to do it, you can't just claim it's implied-- which is the crux of *your* argument. Why is one implied and the other isn't?\n\nWell, because that's a false premise and neither one is implied, or both are implied, or it depends-- either way, it doesn't matter, write it down as a pre-nup if you want your marriage to be conditioned on it.",

It's not automatic that the lower earning partner gets a cut of the higher earning partner's wealth in the divorce.\n\nHowever, more to the point. You asked who gets the alimony if partner B cheats, and let's assume you're right and it is partner B despite being at fault. What about other ways of causing emotional damage? What if partner B doesn't help to take care of children, spends all day gaming or hanging out at the pub with friends, forgets partner A's birthday regularly and is generally an asshole, but not abusive. Partner A gets fed up and divorces partner B. Is paying them alimony in this case ALSO not unfair? Why is cheating so different? \n\nIt's starting to sound like you see marriage simply as an exchange of wealth for sexual exclusivity, which is kinda messed up to be honest.",

How about just a hug or a kiss, is that cheating already? What about watching porn or scantily clad instagram ladies, some people consider that cheating while others don't. I'd say this is far from simple, and for it to be a legal thing it would need to be explicitly defined. And it's not always easy to prove either.\n\nImagine having to go through a court case which publicly shows all your private messages, only to find out that you haven't cheated. This can cause a lot of emotional damage in itself.",

Marriage is when two people enter into a contract that allows them to own property together,  file their taxes together, by default have power of attorney if one of them is unable to make their own medical or financial decision and perhaps some other administrative stuff depending on the exact legislature in the region.\n\nA romantic relationship is when two people decide to share exclusively or non-exclusively things like time, emotional vulnerability and support, and intimacy including sexual intimacy. Those things aren't contractable. The fact that a good romantic relationship often leads to marriage and thus coincides with it doesn't make it the essence of what marriage is about.\n\nIf you think that marriage = monogamy and that's it, you have a very unrealistic view of marriage. You marry your business partner for tax benefits and never have sex with them. It's possible and legal. Sex and marriage are different spheres in the legal sense.",

Marriage can also be a gov recognised union of 2 people, who are also \"ok\" with open relationships.  \nIn that case, as the partners know and agree on each other \"relationship\" status, it's not cheating. It's only one one partner is a victim of deceit, then it's become an issue.  \n\n\nCan \"adultry\" happen outside marriage? Adultry can only be defined within the context of marriage right?\n\nAs if there's no marriage (gov contract signed), how there can be adultery (in the eyes of gov)? But if you have the gov issued marriage license, then adultry shouldn't be that hard to define?",

They need to be fair and just.  You already have the option of creating a prenup that both parties accept how assets will be split if the marriage ends due to infidelity and what qualifies as infidelity, why does the government need to be involved and make this universal?  It doesn't make any sense.",

This would turn every divorce case into an expensive investigation with people hiring private detectives and collecting DNA evidence. The courts are already overwhelmed.\n\n> adultery should be treated as fraud or deceit\n\nAdultery isn't fraud - it's a betrayal of trust. We don't fine people for lying to friends or breaking promises to family members. The government has no business policing emotional commitments.\n\nWhat about cases where someone cheats because their spouse is abusive? Or when they've been separated for years but haven't divorced? Or in situations where both partners had affairs? Your system would force judges to untangle messy personal situations they have no business being involved in.\n\nI've seen friends go through nasty divorces. Adding financial penalties would just make lawyers richer and turn every separation into a witch hunt to prove who cheated first. The current system works fine - cheaters typically end up worse off in divorce settlements anyway when infidelity is proven.\n\nKeep the government out of our bedrooms. Some things are better handled privately, even if they hurt.",

Is that a different marriage contract? What if you want to open your marriage after getting married? Would you have to get in touch with the government and ask for their permission first? \n\nOnce we impose legal consequences for infidelity we have to have a legal definition of what constitutes infidelity.

The fact that marriage is a legally recognised relationship? The fact that it has financial implications? Family ties are also legally recognised.

Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice adultery is a crime that the Army investigates and prosecutes, because it is contrary to good order and discipline.\n\nHere's the challenge, adultery is defined as penetration of the vulva by the penis. It is not kissing, holding hands, exchanging spicy texts, sending each other nudes, being seen holding hands in public. Without evidence that someone had sex, it is pretty difficult to get to prove adultery.\n\nThen you add on that these kinds of investigations, which are often unfounded due to the challenge of finding proof beyond hearsay, really gum up the works of the Army legal system. We waste time investigating it, writing up reports, building the case, and ultimately have the JAG throw it out.\n\nThen you layer on what you might personally consider adultery vs what the law does, and you still end up at a point that you need to make a decision about your relationship. If you SO texting someone feels like cheating to you, and you file a criminal case, and they can't prove adultery, you're still going to have to make a personal decision.\n\nCheating is awful, I just think it's ultimately a personal issue between couple and we don't need to involve the legal system",

The marriage license is an agreement that exists between the state and the married couple as a unit, not between the two people who comprise the married couple. If a couple needs to invoke its marital status (for taxes, inheritance, paternity, divorce, etc.), said couple takes up the issue with the state, not with each other.\n\nEven in the six states that allow spouses to sue for adultery, one spouse doesn\u2019t sue the other; the spouse who didn\u2019t cheat can sue the person who slept with the spouse who did cheat. But since these torts are rooted in the legally archaic view that a wife and her affection are her husband\u2019s property, most states have taken them off the books. \n\nI find no evidence that such a thing as \u201ca marriage contract\u201d exists . Marriage licenses exist, and sometimes pre- or postnuptial agreements are called marriage contracts, but you don\u2019t sign a contract with behavior stipulations in it when you get married. So, what is a marriage contract here? The exchange of religious vows is not a state matter in a secular country.",

Even as a verbal contract, adultery would *never* be enforced based on something this vague. If it were... you better hope you follow all of those vague strictures... no yelling at your spouse when things get \"worse\"...

What you are asking would allow marriage to happen under false-pretenses, with one (or both) pretending they aren't interested in seeking financial penalties in the case of adultery, while knowing that the government will later enforce this on their behalf anyway.

You want partners who are cheated on to be able to punish their spouses. So how does a court tell whether or not cheating occurred?\n\nLets say there's sufficient evidence that someone had sex with someone other than their spouse. Is the burden of proof on them to prove their spouse consented, or on their spouse to prove they didn't?\n\nBecause I don't see how this isn't open to abuse. Do you accept that what you're proposing opens up a situation where one partner could verbally say a relationship was open, leaving no evidence, then claim they never said that after the fact?",

You could argue that prostitution is mostly illegal because of a public health risk, as is alcohol and tobacco. Things that you can do that can easily hurt other people or society are no longer the realm of being immoral.\n\nNow that gay marriage is legal, and minorities and white people can get married, I can't think of a single bedroom type situation that the government regulates. I can have sex with whoever (adult) I want, and the government really can't do much about it, because I have a right to privacy - defined by the judicial system's interpretation of the Constitution.\n\nRegarding your question, I don't want the government telling me who I can have sex with or when I can do it or who it's okay to fuck with and who is not.\n\nWould this make adultery illegal even if your partner is okay with it? Adultery accusations can be difficult to prove, and it's one person's story against another (typically). If my wife tells me that she's okay for me to go out and just have ex with anyone I want whenever I want, and I do it and, and then she gets upset, how can we prove or disprove any of it? Notarized permission forms from your spouse? It's just so intrusive and silly and disruptive and not objective at all, rather it is a subjective gauge of situations with no physical proof except someone's emotions that they display in court. \n\nLaws need to be based on fact, maybe you and I don't agree on what the facts are. I don't think feelings are facts, and I don't think marriage is something that the government should ever be involved in, because every couple and every person has their own beliefs and their own personal opinions about what is moral and what is not.\n\nIf you really care as a married couple, and you agree on what is moral and what is not, just create a prenup that is specific for your relationship and situation. So people can police themselves, and leave the government out of it until one of the couple files for divorce with the agreement in hand and the consequences already established by both parties.",

There is mistake, there is arguably negligence but it does not satisfy the definition of fraud.\n\nWhile we are talking about fraud, what if my fiancee pretends to be a nice person throughout the courtship process but then turns into an arse the moment the ring is slipped upon the finger and makes my life miserable? Should the government fine her every time she fails to make my dinner?\n\nNext up, how the fuck do you put a price on it? You CAN put a price on Fraud (ie, they stole $1k from me) but how do you demonstrate a financial loss for adultery? Is it like an arbitrary fine? $50 per blowjob, $100 per shag?\n\nFinally though, if we are gonna have the government appoint sex inspectors to police our relationships why stop at marriage? Should the government fine my friends when they meet up without me?\n\n\\*\\*P.S. - the cheater faces no consequences?

    "text": "In today's age with everyone having a smartphone and some people even having dashcams, I feel like it would make sense to allow some reports to directly lead to a fine for the traffic violator. A lot of the time, people simply don't care about respecting traffic rules but if they knew that their fellow citizens were more engaged and willing to report them if they're causing a dangerous or unpleasant situation they might think twice.\n\nMy idea would be to allow citizens to submit video evidence of serious traffic violations that can lead to a fine being issued directly after being viewed by the police or other authority. For example: reckless driving, running a red light or whenever a situation actually causes a danger. I don't see why it should be necessary for the police to directly witness something if the video is very clear.\n\nIt could also include parking violations in cases where the illegal parking is either dangerous or is a major inconvenience (a non EV vehicle parking at an EV spot, someone parked in a handicapped space, etc.)\n\nI'll try to respond to some of the main counterarguments I can think of here:\n\n1. It will be used for petty disputes or for revenge reports\n\nThere is indeed a risk that that could happen but my proposed solution for that would be to limit the amount of reports to a single report per year for the same vehicle/person. That way, there is no risk that someone will just follow another person around and keep reporting them. If there is in fact a serious dispute with that person, it would be best for the police to be involved.\n\n2. It will increase the likelihood of wrongly issued fines or even AI altered footage\n\nThere can be ways to make sure that the dashcams are subject to an approval process and also big fines and potential criminal sanctions for people who are caught falsifying evidence. In addition, judges could be more lenient when someone appeals a fine issued based on \"civilian evidence\". Either way, there would be no criminal penalties for any \"citizen reported\" violations, only fines.\n\n3. Some people will compare it to \"informing\" on your fellow citizens which is deemed undesirable\n\nI do see the point that it's uncomfortable knowing that you're potentially being \"watched\" by your fellow citizens I feel like it's still a better solution to encourage citizens to be more active rather than have more police patrols. In any case, this would only concern serious violations or cases where people would probably call the local town hall or police (like parking issues) which would waste their time that they could use focusing on other issues. I don't see this concerning stuff like not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign, speed limit enforcement (which requires specialized equipment), etc.\n\nRather than only being \"afraid\" of the police, citizens would play a more active role in making sure traffic laws are being respected.\n\nIn order to avoid \"vigilantism\" there could also be a maximum cap on the amount of reports you can submit where it's clear that someone is just spending their day driving around and watching for violations to report.\n\n4. It's not possible to identify the perpetrator\n\nThere is a presumption that the perpetrator is the registered owner of the vehicle. If not, they can contest the fine and designate who was driving. This method is already widely used for automatic radar speed enforcement in Europe where the owner gets the fine but if it wasn't them driving they can just say who it was and they will get the fine.\n\n5. The argument that this is already possible in some places\n\nThat might be true but I think that the police/courts are rather apprehensive of this kind of system and prefer that the officers directly witness the event.\n\nEDIT: added a counterargument",

If you snap me with a parking ticket while I run my kid into the restroom for 5 whole minutes, I might get so mad as to appeal and appeal and appeal.  And so then you are stuck spending you own time answering questions about whether you doctored the photo, whether it was targeted enforcement because I wa part of a protected class or minority, what you were doing in the area to begin with, etc. \n\nI then go out and retaliate against the person who snubbed me so they get a ticket too.  And then they put me through the same legal hurdles.  Nothing but fun. \n\nBest to leave this to the robots (traffic cameras) and actual cops.  A nice thought but I think it burdens citizens more than it\u2019s worth.",

Networked systems can't know what device a message came from. They can know what device it *claims* to come from, but they can't know the actual device or its status. A jailbroken device can send a message asserting that it's not jailbroken. You could write an entirely different application that follows the same communication protocol and presents over the network as a non-jailbroken device, and there would be no way to tell.\n\nYou could create a system that's supposed to work this way, but it's impossible to make such a system bulletproof, especially when the devices that are supposed to enforce it are in the hands of people you can't trust.",

It\u2019s 2AM, the road is completely deserted, and you\u2019re going exactly the speed limit in the right-hand lane.\n\nTwo supercharged lowrider cars blow past you at well over 100, easily three times the speed limit, and are gone before you\u2019ve even processed what just happened. It\u2019s a total miracle nobody was killed. Your heart is still pounding in your chest, and you were a completely innocent party.\n\nYour car\u2019s dash cam caught the whole thing as clear as day, including the license plate numbers of both suspects. You\u2019re happy that you\u2019re alive, but pissed that these idiots are out there doing this, so you decide to file a report. Then it hits you: even with clear video, there\u2019s too much that could go wrong for police to be able to issue tickets based on this alone. Between fakes, captures from other vehicles as discussed elsewhere in these comments, and other issues, there\u2019s just too much liability.\n\nInstead, the department will take this citizen-generated report of \u201cdriving too fast\u201d and try to cross-reference it with any reports of any damage or death. Luckily, nothing turns up. But maybe, just maybe, they decide to stake out that stretch of road again. Maybe it\u2019s not the first time these guys have been reported. Who can say.\n\nPoint is: your idea has too much liability and blindspots to have a direct path from report to fine. However, it\u2019s not a waste. Your information could help prevent something awful from happening. The difference between something and nothing is huge, but the difference between something and something more is really not that much in terms of results.",

    "text": "It is largely accepted that Olmert and Barak made the last offers to the Palestinians. Still, some other offers and attempts to relaunch the peace process occurred during the earlier parts of Netanyahu's term.\n\nDuring 2012-2014, there was a secret track between Netanyahu and his attorney, Yitzhak Molho, and Hussein Agha who was close to Abbas. The two nearly reached an understanding which could have been the blueprint to a future agreement but Abbas refused:\n\n\"Netanyahu's secret peace offer concessions to Palestinians revealed\"\n\n[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4634075,00.html](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4634075,00.html)\n\nDuring the talks in 2014, Netanyahu released terrorists to restart negotiations and during the intense talks, Martin Indyk, who is associated with the Left, said \"Netanyahu moved to the zone of a Possible agreement. I saw him sweating bullets to find a way to reach an agreement. We tried to get Abu Mazen to the zone of possible agreement but we were surprised to learn he had shut down. We were ready to go beyond policy positions the U.S. had taken on the core issues to bridge the gaps and resolve it, and therefore there was something in it for him \u2013 and he didn\u2019t answer us. Abbas \\[effectively\\] checked out of the talks in mid-February,\" said Indyk.",

These are not mutually exclusive ideas. \n\nIsraeli political discourse of the 90s and early 00's was dominated by the \"land for peace\" theory where the idea that these legitimate security concerns could be addressed by granting Palestinian territorial sovereignty. Prime ministers won elections on the platform that they would give the entire west bank to the Palestinians. It's quite easy to see that the camp who wants the west bank for ideological reasons can easily be politically sidelined given the right conditions, or in other words, when those very legitimate security concerns are addressed.\n\nIt's hard to take people seriously who can't acknowledge what obvious lessons the second intifada, Gaza withdrawal, and October 7th taught the Israeli mainstream. Namely, that maintaining occupation makes Israelis safe, and withdrawing from Palestinian territory makes Israelis dead.",

You can't sanction them into a different position here.\n\nYour strategy would absolutely work if the Israelis insisted on staying in the west bank for purely ideological reasons. That's why they are unaffected by all the UN resolutions, ICC/ICJ statements and accusations, international backlash, BDS campaign, etc. None of it matters when at the end of the day, they see their military occupation of the Palestinian territories as a necessary thing that keeps them alive.\n\nYou now have the urge to convince me why it's illogical for the Israelis to feel this way. That the Palestinians wouldn't be so upset at them and wouldn't want them dead if they were nicer to them. But there are two things that Israelis know that you, a westerner, doesn't:\n\n1 - they experienced the second intifada. At a time when Israeli willingness to give over the west bank was at an apex, when they had just offered essentially the entire thing over with a full withdrawal, east Jerusalem as a capital, etc., they were targeted by not one, not 5, not 26, not 79, but 130 terrorist attacks each killing one to dozens of people, targetting buses filled with children, cafes, underage bars, pizza shops, etc. They experienced the Gaza withdrawal. After reluctantly but unilaterally pulling out of Gaza down to every last Jew, to create a judenrein territory to meet the Palestinian demand (the same demand that currently stands in regards to the west bank), they watched Hamas take over in a coup and start flooding Israel with terrorist attacks and rockets.\n\n2 - they understand Arabic better than you. They know that when Hamas, the most popular Palestinian government, and the one who would undoubtedly take over the West Bank given an Israeli withdrawal says \"occupation\", they aren't talking about the actual military occupation, they're talking about the entire state of Israel. They know that the Palestinians wouldn't start accepting Israel if it just did the right things, palestinians hate Israel for what it is - a Jewish state, a malignant and temporary anomaly on what is intrinsically Arab land. \"Sea\" and \"free\" doesn't rhyme in Arabic. In the original version, Palestine *is* Arab from water to water.\n\nUntil the average Israeli (who is non religious and doesn't actually care about the ancient Jewish connection to Judea & Samaria) feels that their security concerns are invalid or miscalculated, they simply are not going to vote for someone who wants to give any territory away.\n\nBy the way I'm not even arguing that any of the Israelis are correct for thinking this way. I'm just saying it's true. That they *do* think this way. And if you want to influence them in any direction, you have to understand this basic ethos, and why things like sanctions won't do a damn thing.\n\nYou can call them stupid or evil or any combination of those things. But none of this changes until you address that fundamental Israeli concern.",

We know he is responsible for it: https://www.haaretz.com/2010-07-15/ty-article/tricky-bibi/0000017f-dc84-d3a5-af7f-feae8a9e0000\n\nSecondly, the article doesn't really represent what it claims. Based on the peace process documents we've seen and international law on what the solution should be, this doesn't represent concessions that Israel is offering but rather very nicely worded demands. \n\nFor instance it's recognised internationally and in law that Palestinians have a full right of return. Israel's offer talks about it recognising shared goals, not Palestinian's inalienable human rights, and says it MAY offer resettlement of individuals. Though presented in flowery language, that's actually a restriction and removal of Palestinian rights with it refusing to recognise Palestinian's rights. The same is either stated or implied in all the points leaked. It's a PR exercise to show Israel's refusal to recognise Palestinian rights and International Law in the best possible light, rephrasing Israeli refusal to recognise international law in terms of things like recognising \"emotional ties\".\n\nIt is not Israel making concessions, it's Israel making unacceptable demands.",

It wasn't enough for Israel.\n\nSeveral of Israel's top leaders have said that they will never be satisfied until the whole region has been made Israel's.

Secondly far more trustworthy PMs and Israeli governments then Netanyahu has been willing to misrepresent peace talks with Palestine. Short of an in depth examination of the peace process like Clayton Swisher carrier out for Camp David, it is not sensible to trust a one-sided account.\n\nAlso the US moderator for the process assigned blame to Israel and said Netanyahu's refused to move his positions more than an inch: https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4515821,00.html\n\nIf you look into it you can also see that the Palestinians, as they always do, were willing to make large concessions (Limit refugees, give Israel large amounts of East Jerusalem, letting them keep most of their settlements, etc) but I haven't been able to identify a single concession from Israel either in Netanyahu or Barak's negotiations.",

Right now the focus is mainly about the internal crisis and how people view the current war, which obviously go hand in hand.",

To do this, Palestine has made offers favourable to Israel which allow Israel to get what it wants. Palestine is under no legal obligation to do so and is losing large amounts of its land, but it is making compromises in the name of peace.",

Even if some Palestinian managed to come up with the perfect compromise that left every Jew and Palestinian happy, there is simply no way he could force his solution through if Israel wanted to stop it. Hell, at least two separate Palestinian peacemakers/moderates were murdered by their own people when they tried to advocate against bloody war. Its clear to me that no Palestinian has the power to create peace, and that any who try would likely be harmed by Hamas/PLF before he got too far, and stonewalled by Israel even if he somehow survived Hamas and the PLF.\n\nI could, however, name a single Israeli who had the power to change the status quo. Netyanhu is the head of state of Israel, which has an economy that is over 1000x the size of Gaza + West bank put together. His military is 10x their size, far better equipped, far better trained, with fully functional air superiority at all times and tons of artillery.\n\nFurthermore, Netyanhu has been in power for two decades. If Netyanhu wanted a two-state solution, he could have easily pushed one through. If he wanted a  one-state solution, he also could have easily pushed it through. My only conclusion is that he wants an extended conflict where both sides take grievous casualties on a regular basis (with the Palestinians taking 100x more). He wants terrorists to randomly blow up Israeli citizens, as every time one of those attacks happens his party gets tens of thousands more votes at the polls.\n\nBecause Netyanhu is the only person in the region who decisively had the power to stop these attacks - whether through a one state solution or a two state solution - and he still has not bothered to try.",

The right of return is part of the broader\u00a0human rightsconcept of\u00a0freedom of movement\u00a0and is also related to the legal concept of\u00a0nationality.[1]While many states afford their citizens the\u00a0right of abode, the right of return is not restricted to citizenship or nationality in the formal sense.[2]It allows\u00a0stateless\u00a0persons and for those born outside their country to return for the first time, so long as they have maintained a \"genuine and effective link\".[2][3]\nThe right is formulated in several modern treaties and conventions, most notably in the 1948\u00a0Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966\u00a0International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\u00a0and the 1948\u00a0Fourth Geneva Convention. Legal scholars have argued that one or more of these\u00a0international human rights instruments\u00a0have attained the status of\u00a0customary international law\u00a0and that the right of return is therefore binding on non-signatories to these conventions.[4][5]\nThe right of return is often invoked by representatives of\u00a0refugee\u00a0groups to assert that they have a right to return to the country from which they were displaced.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re clearly just soapboxing and I wish the mods would delete this post instead of so obviously protecting Zionist soapbox displays.",

However, that war could have been avoided, along with the refugee problem, had the Arab side accepted territorial compromise from the outset, in the form of the 1947 UN partition plan. At the end of the war, although many local Arabs had fled, many also remained. Those that remained became full citizens of Israel. By contrast, no Jews remained in any of the areas of Mandatory Palestine conquered by neighboring Arab countries like Jordan and Egypt. They either were expelled or killed. Moreover, the conflict also created hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees who were forced to leave their homes in Arab countries. Unlike the Palestinians, these Jews moved on and settled in other countries and are no longer refugees.\n\nHaving lost the territorial war, Arab leaders began to view the refugees as another weapon in their war to eliminate the State of Israel, as documented in\u00a0*The War of Return*, the authoritative new book by Dr. Einat Wilf and Adi Schwartz. In the words of Egyptian Foreign Minister Muhammad Salah al-Din in October 1949, \u201cIt is well known and understood that the Arabs, in demanding the return of the refugees to Palestine, mean their return as masters of the Homeland and not as its slaves. With greater clarity, they mean the liquidation of the State of Israel.\u201d[\\[2\\]](https://unwatch.org/item-7/claim/claim-5-palestinian-refugees-have-a-right-of-return/#_ftn2)\u00a0Thus, the refugee issue has always been political rather than legal. Indeed, recognizing that this is a political issue which can only be resolved through negotiations, the Palestinians agreed in the Oslo Accords that it would be dealt with in final status negotiations.[\\[3\\]](https://unwatch.org/item-7/claim/claim-5-palestinian-refugees-have-a-right-of-return/#_ftn3)\n\nThe Palestinians base their claim to a legal \u201cright of return\u201d into the sovereign State of Israel on Paragraph 11 of General Assembly Resolution 194(III) of December 11, 1948 titled\u00a0*Palestine \u2013 Progress report of the United Nations Mediator*. That resolution established a conciliation commission to mediate a resolution to the conflict. In that context, it included provisions concerning negotiating a final settlement (Para 6), Holy Places (Para 7), Jerusalem (Paras 8-9), facilitating economic development of the area (para 10) and refugees (para 11).",

According to the testimony of the commander of the operation, Ben-Zion Cohen, most of the Irgun and Lehi fighters at preparatory meetings agreed the aim should be one of the \"liquidation of all the men in the village and any other force that opposed us, whether it be old people, women, or children.\"[^(\\\\)33\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre#cite_note-hogan-35)[^(\\\\)46\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre#cite_note-Aderet-48)\n\nThe massacre at Der Yesin and in other villages had the above desired effect, and was the direct reason that the surrounding Arab states became involved in the conflict:\n\n>Other [anti-Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Arab) massacres and [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing) operations followed Deir Yassin, including the [Dawayima massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawayima_massacre), [Lydda massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydda_massacre), [Safsaf massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safsaf_massacre), [Battle of Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Haifa_(1948)), and the [Sasa massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasa_massacre), among others,[^(\\\\)118\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre#cite_note-126) with [Mapam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapam)'s leaders later concluding that the attacks on Deir Yassin and Haifa were the two pivotal events of the Palestinian exodus.\n\n>News of the killings was widely publicized, sparking terror among Palestinians across the country, frightening many to flee their homes in anticipation of further violence against civilians by advancing Jewish forces. The massacre greatly accelerated the [1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight) and strengthened the resolve of Arab governments to intervene, which they did five weeks later, beginning the [1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_war).\n\n>[Azzam Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azzam_Pasha), Secretary General of the [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League), stated that \"The massacre of Deir Yassin was to a great extent the cause of the wrath of the Arab nations and the most important factor for sending \\[in\\] the Arab armies.\"[^(\\\\)120\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre#cite_note-128) The arrival of tens of thousands of refugees further convinced them to act.\n\nIsrael would go on to destroy and take hundreds of villages, often destroying wells and other infrastructure to prevent their inhabitants return.\n\nIsrael is absolutely responsible for their flight.",

And in return for generously offering that kind of \"state\", Israel's offers demand concessions, such as the right to deploy Israel's military in the Palestinian state in \"emergencies\", a standing IDF presence in defined parts of the Palestinian \"state\"'s territory, partial annexation of the West Bank by Israel, and Palestinians and their descendants signing away all claims to possessions previously stolen by Israel.",

The 2 state offers Palestinians  turned down never included a Palestinian state, and ultimately they all boil down to:\n\n\"*Palestinians give up any and all historic claims they have to anything, and Israel stops expanding the settlements, for real this time, trust me bro. And we'll call the Palestinian territory a Palestinian state now.*\"\n\nEver since the Oslo accords, the 2 state solution was never about 2 states. It's about one state, Israel, with one or two Banthustans inside of it. And we all know from historical precedent that Banthustans aren't going to resolve anything.",

    "text": "This is better phrased as a question: Why can't Republicans support good policy?\n\nAs much as the premise is somewhat self righteous, I'm looking for a legitimate answer. This isn't the thread to comment something like \"because the republican party is inherently a bunch of fascist pedophiles\" or whatever.\n\nAnyways, an example of what I mean could be heallthcare reform. Literally\\* everyone would benefit from this policy. Obviously citizens would benefit from free medical assistance, but regulating healthcare as a whole would make it demonstrably less expensive in terms of government expenditure, and would reduce insurance premiums. Wouldn't these things (alongside a healthy workforce) be a boon for businesses as well?\n\nYou could also look at immigration. Even George Bush has advocated for immigration reform, and pointed out the inability of skilled workers to easily join the country has a direct, measurable impact on GDP, even for non-immigrant citizens. Everyone would benefit from changing this, right?\n\nThis obviously isn't to suggest the Democratic party is a perfect thing, but they seem to be trying to fix these things to some extent (as evidenced through the number of bills introduced that never make it to law)?\n\nPolls have shown a strong majority of Americans support similar policies, even in our current poltical landscape. Surely this would help the Republicans pick up on the 100+ million apathetic voters? I think it's something of a given that the current state of the party is one driven by identity politics, but economic and social policy are entirely different things. You can lower the deficit while still making a big fuss over illegal immigrants or some other current thing. So... why not?\n\n\\* Okay, maybe not insurance companies, but I don't see how they could possibly have \\*that much power\\* as to control and block what is a fundamental role of government in other countires.\n\n# Edit\n\nI'm getting a lot of answers about how this is technically \"working\". Is it though? Every election in recent history has been won on razor-thin margins, and the winner is a coin flip. Surely they could still improve their results?\n\n# Edit 2\n\nLots of comments on how Republican voters really do feel like their policy is good. To be honest, I'm not sure how to interact with these comments as \"but *why* is America simply more right-wing than other Western countries?\" feels like the start of a very long very unquantifiable back-and-forth.",

After all, we know what our beliefs are and we know that we came to those beliefs through rational thoughts and decision making. Let's just go with the assumption that the average person is legitimately reasonable and capable of thinking rationally. \n\nRepublicans think they are reasonable too. If you ask the average Republican \"Do you think poor people should have reliable access to healthcare?\" They would probably reply that they do. It's just the mechanism for providing that access that Democrats and Republicans tend to disagree on. The average Republican truly believes that healthcare wouldn't be so expensive, and thus inaccessible, if the healthcare industry was deregulated and hospitals were allowed to compete with each other like other businesses. They aren't thinking \"I want poor people to die, so I'm gonna make healthcare more expensive, MUAHAHA!\", they are acknowledging the problem and thinking of solutions.\n\nSimilarly with immigration, the vast majority of Republicans acknowledge that immigration is a good thing for our economy, when it's legal. If it's illegal, they'd say it could be helpful, it could also be hurting us. To a Republican, our country is safer and better off if we simply know who's coming in, and turning away all the ne'er-do-wells. Again, most Republicans would admit that we are in need of immigration reform to make it easier, cheaper, and faster to legally immigrate, but that we still need strong borders to keep illegal drugs, human traffickers, gang members, etc, out.\n\nSo to summarize, it's not that Republicans are evil, it's that you need to understand that they are simply seeking alternate solutions to the same problems Democrats are",

Under our current system, winning by a single vote is exactly identical in result to getting 100% of the vote.\n\nThis *does* incentivize narrow wins, for the simple reason that getting a slight advantage is much easier and equally effective. If what the republicans are doing is consistently getting them marginal victories - which it is - it's more rational to stick with that than to try and get a bigger margin. That risks losing their voter base if it fails, and doesn't give them anything better than they currently have if it succeeds. So why bother?\n\nThe way to change this is to change the voting system but, under the current voting system, yes. Any votes past 51% are irrelevant and it's far easier to get a marginal victory than a landslide, so that's what both parties are aiming for. It's not a coincidence that election wins are so narrow these days.",

        "text": "Healthcare reform: Pie in the sky pipe dream. Most Universal Healthcare countries are struggling to provide adequate care. Private healthcare is booming in the UK as the NHS has year+ long wait lists and is denying people for operations based on BMI. Record number of Brits are paying 100% out of pocket abroad to get needed medical care. Don't get me started with the horror stories you would never even dream of hearing about in the US. \n\nMeanwhile in Canada, they've been sending cancer patients to the US for treatment since the 90's. \n\nAm I \"evil\" because I see this as a poor system that doesn't work like you think it does? And not to mention, it's not \"free\". And I don't even mean paying for it for your entire life is not a good value. I mean, nearly all of these countries still charge a % of the bill directly to patients, have co-pays, or have some sort of patient billing, etc\n\nImmigration: Stopping the influx of undocumented strangers is not the same as \"immigration reform to make it easier for skilled workers to come\". You're being disingenuous if you think Republicans just want to close the country off to everyone. They want people coming here, legally, based on merits. \n\nDo you really think Republicans are evil because they're concerned over lawlessness, terrorism, and crime? \n\nThe \"problem\" that Republicans are trying to \"fix\" is the idea our country is some kind of free for all where anyone can just waltz in and do whatever they want. Democrats aren't trying to fix that. They're trying to exacerbate it. And that's partly why Kamala lost. They saw through the veneer of Kamala acting like she would do anything about border security.",

They were strange bedfellows and the peace had been kept over the years only by the liberals talking a good game on equality but then the southern senators (who tended to not be voted out as their states were very solidly blue, so had long careers and committee chairmanships) would stop it progressing.\n\nWhen LBJ pushed through civil rights we saw the South break away, first as third parties with Barry Goldwater and then switching to Republicans after Republicans started to appeal to racism with their \"Southern Strategy\", dropping the principles of Lincoln that they had until then embraced.\n\nStorm Thurmond is the classic example of this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond and you can read about the Southern Strategy https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy\n\nTo quote Lee Atwater:\n\n> You start out in 1954 by saying, \u201cNigger, nigger, nigger.\u201d By 1968 you can\u2019t say \u201cnigger\u201d\u2014that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states\u2019 rights, and all that stuff, and you\u2019re getting so abstract. Now, you\u2019re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\u2019re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.\u2026 \u201cWe want to cut this,\u201d is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \u201cNigger, nigger.\u201d\n\nEssentially they're using dog whistle politics. The millions of people who care know what they mean and vote for them based on it. Because they've been leaning into it for decades it's become almost totemic - Republicans must support \"States Rights\" and hardline opposition to illegal immigration is a must have.\n\nAny Republican trying to move away from this would see a lack of support from their base.",

Making more money for them personally or making their base feel better both benefit republicans even if it\u2019s at the expense of anything else. I agree they should try to appeal to more than xenophobia but they DID win the house senate and presidency so it\u2019s not like what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working for them.",

    "text": "Many forms of cultural appropriation *are bad*.For instance, I personally struggle with various mental health issues, and I find it upsetting when mental illness is often misrepresented through stereotypes.\n\nHowever, I find most instances of cultural appropriation do not carry the same weight of harm and are completely acceptable. When I wear jade or turquoise earrings, I am not wearing them because I want to look more Native American; I wear them because they look pretty. Similarly, many people wear Romani dresses because they admire their aesthetic, not to steal or diminish the culture they represent. Braids are worn because they make people look pretty, not to steal someone's culture.\n\nIn the realm of fiction, characters like ninjas or vikings can be embraced without cultural appropriation when used appropriately. For example, dressing as a Dungeons & Dragons viking character is not an act of cultural appropriation, as it exists within a fictional universe that everyone involved understands as separate from real-world cultures.\n\nCultural appropriation should be viewed through the lens of of context, impact, and intent. It becomes problematic only when it is used inappropriately or disrespectfully. While there are certainly valid concerns about cultural appropriation reinforcing harmful stereotypes, the majority of examples of cultural appropriation do not meet this threshold.\n\nThese forms of cultural appreciation cause no harm, yet are consistently being shared on blogs and news stories as some form of embarrassment. Even my own university prints out fliers in an effort to help student make these mistakes.\n\nCMV: Most examples of cultural appropriation cause no harm to any culture, ethnicity, or people.fin",

But I can see how it happened - a sort of mob mentality fueled by an awkward interview.",

If the even a chunk of the 95% of non-indigenous decide they like (insert cultural feature here), the natural response of the market and culture will be to cater to the biggest base, essentially steamrolling the needs of the indigenous to meet the demands of the majority. This is currently happening with white sage. It's a sacred plant to indigenous groups but demand for it has skyrocketed, which means it's now being mass produced and is subject to artificial selection. The nature of the plant itself is being changed, and indigenous people are literally losing their sacred plant because other groups want it. \n\nEssentially, it's very, **very** difficult for the dominant group to adopt a minority cultural practice without drastically, sometimes irreparably, altering it, and if you adopt it without knowing much about it, you're much more likely to unintentionally bungle it. The same is true for cultural practices that don't have a product. \n\nIf the majority calling meetings \"powwows\", most people's exposure to the word \"powwow\" will be in that context instead of an actual powwow, and it has caused the word to change, and because words are defined by how people use them, the dominant group controls this more than minorities do.",

And quite a few other belief systems. Which may have helped some of the more recent Christian conversations in history. \n \nConversely yet related, the Catholic concept of Saints seems to have helped with their conquest of Central and South America; the concept of a cadre of lesser gods working underneath a greater deity being both an ostensibly Catholic concept, as well as the general indigenous concept. \n \nDominant cultures tend to find ways to adopt the ore existing belief systems into their own as a way to win the common folk over. Sometimes they literally demonize the old gods/heroes, sometimes they argue that the old were the misunderstood new (Greece and Rome, for example, or Jesus being born in December).",

That's how we got, for instance, rock and jazz music that are now entirely different from what they were at their roots (a fact some \"progressives\" opposed to cultural appropriation hate because oh noes, that's exploitation), and that's wonderful. That's how we got some widespread motives in the history of culture, constantly permutating in different paintings, poems, or musical works, to the extent we often don't know, and even more often don't care, where does the motive come from (and they can often be traced to some folk roots). It's great and beautiful that culture is alive and that all forms of exchange, appropriation, permutation, and assimilation take place. Neither xenophobes who attempt to isolate from foreign cultures, nor progressives who hate appropriation and \"exploitation\", will stop that beautiful engine of human culture.",

        "text": "Cultural appropriation is always harmful. You're confusing it with cultural appreciation. But \"appropriation\" actually necessitates that it harms another culture by colonizing/erasing said culture. Appropriating something isn't simply participating in it, it's trying to completely take it over, or replace it with something else, or mock the culture.\n\nThe actual dictionary definition is \"when a person or group adopts elements of a culture other than their own *in a way that's considered inappropriate or unacknowledged*\". In other words, if you're acknowledging that this is not your culture and you are appreciating it, that's not appropriation. If you're pretending that it's not stealing from another culture though, and you're ignorant and/or malicious about it, or you're intentionally trying to mock or disenfranchise another culture for your own selfish reasons, then that's when it becomes appropriation. The moment it steps into the territory of being harmful is when it becomes appropriation instead of appreciation.\n\nExample of cultural appreciation: Buying and wearing a traditional African-made clothing item with traditional African patterns and materials on it. You've learned about the culture, and any time someone asks you about it you love explaining to them about that region and where you got the clothing item from, what it means, etc. You may even encourage them to buy something from there too, which uplifts that culture and appreciates its beauty. \n\nWhen it turns into appropriation: A luxury brand that adopts traditional African patterns without engaging with the communities behind them is exploiting this culture and even changing it to fit their audience and be more marketable for a quick million. This does not appreciate or uplift the culture, it just colonizes and erases it. They made a small change to it and then called it their own, and none of the proceeds went to that region/people who invented the culture.",

The same could be said for any manufactured goods. The US auto makers certainly felt threatened by it.\n\nIn fact plenty of developing countries did and do this for a whole range of products.\n\nWhat this shows is that generally there has to be a principle of hegemony: a richer and more powerful group disenfranchising a less powerful group. Without that principle, everything could be called cultural appropriation. Because who gets to decide what is disrespectful and disenfranchising?\n\nThe problem is people will rarely agree that they belong to a hegemonic group\u2026 so the arguments continue.",

I also think everyday, useful inventions like cars, planes, trains, lamps, lightbulbs, fans, medicines, etc. aren't really a part of a specific nation's \"culture\". It's definitely part of their history for sure--that's where those inventions came from, and no one can take that from them--but once that invention gets out, it becomes humanity's property, not just a specific country's property. For example when insulin was invented in Canada, obviously the whole world is going to jump on that. That's not cultural appropriation, because that's a life-saving medicine needed by all people, regardless of culture. Not to mention once other countries got their hands on it, it needed further experimentation, innovation, and purification to become what it is today. That's how inventions work in terms of utility. But that same concept doesn't apply to a richer, more powerful group stealing ideas from a less powerful but more creative group and exploiting that group for their own selfish gain, like you mentioned.",

                "text": "If they're actually sticking to the culture and increasing the bandwidth of it, that's great. Unfortunately, most of these massive corporations do not do that at all, and they definitely appropriate cultures and exploit them for their own monetary gain. It's unfortunate, but people let it slide because America itself is quite bereft of any real culture besides capitalism. There are some areas like Appalachia of course, but even then, those areas are appropriated and commodified too. Over time a lot of individual cultures within the US have been thoroughly erased and colonized to the point where they don't even really represent the original culture anymore. For that reason, people value authentic food places nowadays, so they aren't really being exploited or out-competed unless a wealthy white corporation intentionally tries to do so.",

He tried shutting down Hawaiian businesses if they had those words in their names. Imagine using words that are foreign to you then trying to force the people who speak the language not be able to use their own language in their businesses. That\u2019s weaponized cultural appropriation. Hawaiians don\u2019t care if you want to open up your own sushi/poke businesses and use Hawaiian words as the name for your restaurant. They care if you\u2019re harassing them about using their own language in their businesses because Frielander went from cultural appreciation (creating a Poke businesses and naming it Aloha Poke) to cultural appropriation (trying to harm Hawaiian businesses by utilizing cease and desists letters for very common words).\n\n> Tasha Kahele of \u201cAloha Poke Stop\u201d in Anchorage (now \u201cLei\u2019s Poke Stop\u201d), spent thousands of dollars rebranding in order to avoid legal action from Frielander\u2019s legal representation, Olson and Cepuritis LTD.\n\nA Native Hawaiian woman was barred from using her own language in her business and then had to spend thousands because she dared to want to use her language. This is where it moves from appreciation to appropriation. Despite how for English words, if the words are common enough, you can\u2019t trademark it, they committed a double standard where common words in Hawaiian were able to be trademarked.",

What are the chances that everyone was offended but then every person of the race they stereotyped were chill. You would expect variance even among ppl of the same culture.

                    "text": "Sharing in and appreciating a culture is fine, that's not harmful at all. It's celebrated, actually. Appropriating it though would look like luxury American clothing companies adopting the Scottish kilt and changing it to make it look more American, not at all acknowledging that it's literally a traditional Scottish kilt, and then they call it their own and make it a trend in America to the point where they're just exploiting Scottish culture to make profits off of it and then claiming that culture to be their own original idea. This doesn't uplift or celebrate Scottish culture at all, especially if the design they come up with looks terrible and actually does an injustice to the culture. This would be an example of taking over someone else's culture, or colonizing it, also known as cultural appropriation. In the worst cases, it looks like a wealthy white restaurant corporation opening a new Americanized Thai restaurant that outcompetes all of the authentic Thai restaurants in the area and puts those \\*actual\\* Thai families out of business, both exploiting and erasing their culture. All the while claiming they are \"authentic Thai food\" when they're not. They're American food with some Thai spices mixed in. I guarantee you that actual Thai people would \\*not\\* find this amusing or cute.\n\nTo relate this back to your video of the guy wearing Mexican and Chinese clothing, it would be a different story if he was making cheap knockoffs of their clothing and selling them for profit, thus erasing their culture and commodifying/colonizing it for his own selfish gain. Any kind of colonizing, exploiting, or erasing behaviors towards a culture that do not acknowledge the culture in any meaningful way or engage with those communities, is appropriation. But if that guy actually did his research and he wanted to participate in and learn about their culture by talking to them, then that's not appropriation at all. However, I highly doubt that's what he wanted to do. In fact, he was editing clips of these people to use them for his own political agenda, which is exploitative in and of itself (and thus his whole video is cultural appropriation). And what's worse is it's using those people's positive reactions to try and make it seem \"okay\" that he's exploiting them to push his agenda. That's probably why college students were offended, because they realized what he was doing. He definitely wasn't learning about and appreciating their cultures in good faith, that much is certain.",

Those same Native American communities whose jewelry designs you're wearing face massive poverty rates and cultural erasure.\n\n> Cultural appropriation should be viewed through the lens of context and intent\n\nIntent doesn't matter as much as impact. If I accidentally step on your foot, it still hurts even though I didn't mean to. The context here is centuries of colonialism and oppression that can't be separated from how we interact with other cultures today.\n\nYour D&D example actually proves my point. Vikings are fair game because Scandinavian cultures aren't marginalized or struggling to preserve their heritage. But when people casually adopt elements from cultures that are actively fighting to maintain their traditions and identity, it's different.\n\nThe \"no harm\" argument ignores how appropriation contributes to stereotyping and commodification. When non-Japanese people throw around ninja imagery, it reduces a complex cultural tradition to a pop culture trope. Over time, this dilutes and distorts how these cultures are understood and represented.\n\nI'd challenge you to think about why you feel entitled to use other cultures' elements purely for aesthetic value. There's plenty of beautiful jewelry and clothing that doesn't come with this baggage.",

Let's go:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarriage, at its core, is nothing more than a legal contract giving a few extra rights to each partner and might help fulfill some religious requirements. Divorce rates are extremely high and statistically speaking, a massive chunk of marriages are doomed to fail. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big problems come in when the divorce process comes in.

Alimony is terrible in every sense of the word, in my opinion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrenups exist to prevent this. It should be an inherent process for the couple to discuss how they want a potential divorce to proceed. If anything, it sounds like common sense. No matter how much \"trust\" you have for your partner, logically speaking you should at least *prepare*. Anything can happen. And the last thing you want is to be stuck paying 25% of your check to your ex for the rest of your life because they cheated on you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cheating part is an even stronger case: whether we like to admit it or not, cheating is very common, especially in this day and age. Its a big factor in many divorces. I personally think its incredibly unfair to be forced to pay the person cheating on you half of your shit all because of legal marriage process, and now they get to live on your dime while still sleeping with the person they ruined your marriage for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd THEN there's when kids are involved. Deciding on who gets custody of the child in case divorce happens should be priority number 1. Making a fail-safe plan so that way the kid won't be potentially stuck with the abusive parent or something along those lines. I don't think this issue can be resolved with a prenup cause there's a shit ton of factors that can develop over time, but I at the very least think there should be a more significant and mandatory initial planning process in case something DOES happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah. Pls change my view. Also keep in mind this is a very gender-neutral standpoint, prenups and divorce can affect either partner depending on the couple. Pls keep sexist shit to yourself, thanks",

        "text": ">Marriage, at its core, is nothing more than a legal contract giving a few extra rights to each partner and might help fulfill some religious requirements\n\nI want to stop you right up top, because I think what you've described marriage as is not what most married people would describe is the core of marriage.  You've described what a lot of us would call the superficial view of marriage, the outer layer.  Marriage, at its core, is a formal declaration and promise to join lives as life partners in the most meaningful and celebrated ceremony humans have, dating back thousands of years.  Many of these ceremonies are religious, many are not.\n\n>The big problems come in when the divorce process comes in. Gotta give the other person half your shit. All those years you spent working hard to achieve your goals or all that money you saved up? Gotta hand it to the other person no matter what. Alimony is terrible in every sense of the word, in my opinion. \n\nThat assumes those things are yours.  Many people don't bring massive amounts of assets into a marriage, they accumulate assets and wealth over the life of the marriage and it belongs to both parties equally.  That's how it gets split 50/50.  Alimony is fairly rare, about 10% of divorces have some provision.\n\nA prenup is a helpful thing when entering a marriage when you already have assets, because it can ensure that the wealth you had prior to the marriage is protected.  Wealth earned during the marriage is harder, you can put the provisions of how it'll be split in your prenup but extenuating circumstances and such, it can be hard to enforce exactly.\n\nYou cannot add child care/support provisions in a prenup.\n\nThe majority of marriages, especially first marriages, do not end in divorce.  I don't know what the stastics are as far as amount of wealth brought into a marriage... I know that for my wife and I, we had nothing.  A prenup would have been entirely useless.  At this point, if something horrible happened and we were to get a divorce, it seems incredibly reasonable to me that we would split our assets equally.\n\nAll of that also ignores that prenups are not free, you have to get a lawyer to write it up for you.  And if you don't want one or it's not applicable to your situation, that's kind of an undue burden on the whole process.  Really, the people coming out most ahead on your idea are lawyers.",

        "text": "The whole point of splitting what is earned during marriage in a divorce is because a in majority of marriages, work work and home work are not both divided perfectly evenly. Especially when there are kids involved, (but even when there aren\u2019t) one spouse will commonly do more work around the house while one earns more money or all of the money. It\u2019s unfair to leave the spouse earning less money out to dry because of the way work was divided.\u00a0\n\nIf all relationships come with a prenup, it\u2019ll be very risky to ever devote a significant amount of time to housework. Both spouses need to be working enough to make themselves financially independent so they aren\u2019t made penniless in a divorce. But that makes things a lot more complicated, people need to work a lot more hours, which is particularly bad if you have kids.\n\nThe fact is, in marriage, you share what you own, and so things need to get fairly split in a divorce, regardless of who actually produced it. If you aren\u2019t ready to share and risk losing some of something, don\u2019t get married. Nobody is forcing you to get married, and it\u2019s not something that should really be done willy nilly anyways. You would be prepared to commit your life to it.",

If you sign a pre-nup, that outlines that both parties get what they came into the marriage with. If in ten years you won the lottery, your wife/husband would still be entitled to some of it, if not half. If your career took off and you asked your partner to quit their career to take care of children, they could absolutely get alimony. If you rented before marriage and bought a house post-marriage, that is split as well. Pre-nups and alimony are totally separate things, so having a pre-nup would in no way guarantee you wouldn't have alimony. That's like saying you can sign a pre-nup and then not be on the hook for child support, not how that works. Unless you got a pre-nup that outlines every tiny minute possibility and it's legally binding (some people try to DIY their pre-nup and find out that it holds no water in court), you can be on the hook for many things with a pre-nup.\n\nPre-nups are for assets people had before they got married, not ones they gained after.",

Alimony is almost never awarded - that was for homemakers who spent their working years raising children, basically no modern person with income earning potential of their own is getting alimony and on the off chance that they do, it generally only lasts for a few years. If a woman dedicates her life to a man and raises his children instead of working at an income-earning job, you think it's right for her to just be penniless out on her ass in the event of a divorce? Her domestic labor had no value?\n\nAlso, the majority of Americans don't even have savings lol they are not losing much in a divorce and a lot of divorces don't even require attorneys. Prenups can be prohibitively expensive and if you have no assets to protect, why bother? Custody and childcare agreements written in prenups aren't even enforceable a lot of the time.\u00a0",

I personally know guys that have been paying their ex wives alimony for the last 6 years and unless she gets married again...they will have to keep on doing it. They lost a portion of their pensions, most of the house value and still have to pay child support. Some of these guys are paying out almost 60% of their income to their ex wives for alimony and child support. They had to move back in with their elderly parents because you can't pay for a car, food and 1 bedroom apartment on 40% of most salaries.",

For Black Americans specifically, marriage is associated with a 400% increase in household wealth. Prenups can actually make wealth-building harder by keeping assets separate and preventing true financial partnership.\n\nYour point about alimony assumes both partners are starting from equal footing. But reality check - one partner often sacrifices career advancement to support the other's growth or handle domestic labor. Without protections, they'd be economically screwed after divorce despite their contributions to building that wealth together.\n\nThe child custody thing is actually a perfect example of why blanket prenups are problematic. You can't predict future circumstances. What if one parent develops an addiction? What if abuse happens? The courts need flexibility to protect kids' interests based on current situations, not decade-old agreements.\n\nI get the impulse to want everything laid out logically. But marriage is one of the few legal structures that helps level the playing field and build collective power. Making prenups universal would mainly benefit those who already have wealth/privilege while hurting folks trying to build security together.\n\nIt's kinda like how means-testing other social programs often hurts the people who need help most. Sometimes the \"logical\" solution actually perpetuates inequality.",

Divorce rates are extremely high and statistically speaking, a massive chunk of marriages are doomed to fail.\n\nIt's a contract, it has nothing to do with religion. \n\nDivorce rates aren't extremely high. Also, if you look only at first-time marriages, it's much lower. \n\nThe big problems come in when the divorce process comes in. Gotta give the other person half your shit. All those years you spent working hard to achieve your goals or all that money you saved up? Gotta hand it to the other person no matter what. Alimony is terrible in every sense of the word, in my opinion.\n\nAlimony is entirely something else and almost never awarded nowadays. \n\nAlso, yes, in a cp state, BOTH parties split MARITAL assets. Prenups have nothing to do with that, they deal with PREMARITAL assets.\n\n>Prenups exist to prevent this. It should be an inherent process for the couple to discuss how they want a potential divorce to proceed. If anything, it sounds like common sense. No matter how much \"trust\" you have for your partner, logically speaking you should at least\u00a0*prepare*. Anything can happen. And the last thing you want is to be stuck paying 25% of your check to your ex for the rest of your life because they cheated on you.\n\nNo, they don't. See above. Also, why would you be paying your check to your ex? What are you even talking about?\n\n>And THEN there's when kids are involved. Deciding on who gets custody of the child in case divorce happens should be priority number 1. Making a fail-safe plan so that way the kid won't be potentially stuck with the abusive parent or something along those lines. I don't think this issue can be resolved with a prenup cause there's a shit ton of factors that can develop over time, but I at the very least think there should be a more significant and mandatory initial planning process in case something DOES happen.\n\nNot something to put in a prenup. \n\nYou don't seem to know what a prenup even is, or how divorce asset division works, so ...",

I strongly disagree with your opinion that alimony is terrible, though.\n\nAlimony is necessary. Work it into the prenup maybe, establish how much it should be from the start. But for some families alimony is necessary.\n\nThere are families where one of the parents decides to stay home to take care of the children full time. There may be a number of reasons for this. This means they are out of the workforce, don't gain work experience and don't have a career. This is a trade off for a more advantageous situation for the family as a whole. Stay at home parents can only do this if they are guaranteed to get alimony in case of a divorce. Again, you can work out the amount in the prenup.\n\nBut if alimony didn't exist, they would be at the mercy of their partners. If the partner leaves, you are economically destroyed possibly for the rest of your life. If you want to leave, you can't because you can't earn money. Alimony solves all of this.",

Divorce rates are extremely high and statistically speaking, a massive chunk of marriages are doomed to fail.\n\n  \nI would say those two points alone show the flaw with your CMV. People view marriage that way and that's what leads to the high divorce rates. It's a self fulfilling prophecy, the more people view it as only a legal contract, the more required divorces and pre-nups become. And if it's an escalating self-fulfilling prophecy, then the real issue is which outcome would we prefer to have.\n\nForcing pre-nups, forces this mindset that it's a temporary and legal covering only. You launch that law and suddenly that definition of marriage that all the happily married people disagree with becomes the actual definition. You'll have a law that means when anyone thinks about marriage, they immediately start with the idea of divorce as a non-negative outcome, making them far more common. You'll end with a system where marriage for everyone but it's shallow and less meaningful, but also that everyone is protected.\n\nThe other extreme is something like banning divorce. Marriage becomes incredibly sacred meaningful, but you get people that aren't protected. Trapped in abusive relationships or in a world where you just ban prenups, no financial protection.\n\nThere's a third option, which enables but doesnt push either option and thats what we currently have. Making prenups a thing but optional. You get the best and worst of both worlds. Marriage isnt as intense, but still has value to those that dont consider it an option. You still have abusive relationships but the predicatable ones are protected.\n\n  \nPersonally I think option 3 is the bst.",

Most humans avoid looking at themselves and their faults. Looking at ourselves and being willing to own up to all the ways that we fall short of who we could be is really hard. Marriage as an institution, when vows are taken seriously, is a pathway to showing you on a very intimate level how selfish and self-centered you really are in order to become the better version of you that you are capable of being. The easier it is to leave a marriage the easier it is to avoid dealing with the reality of who you really are. \n\nWhen I say you I don't mean you, OP, I'm in particular.

Why is it sus to not want to enter a supposedly life-long relationship and being asked to explicitly plan for its demise, and to do so in a way that shows that the person that would vow to love you til death do you part actually wants to you to get nothing in the event of a divorce?\n\nIt is supposed to be a partnership, not an \"I'm just in it for me\" arrangement. The fact that the OP self-describes as an aromantic means that it is not surprising that they would think that marriage is nothing more than \"a legal contract giving a few extra rights to each partner and might help fulfill some religious requirements\". In reality, it signifies more than that. Marriage creates a bond between two people that having a prenuptial agreement trivializes. Frankly, it surprised me just how much it affected me to get married in the depth of feelings I had for Mrs GadgetGamer.\n\nThis is why it will be extremely difficult to change anybody's view here, because at its core this is an emotional argument that cannot be defeated with statements of logic. Before I was married, I was more like the OP and just did it because it was socially expected. If someone told me that I would feel completely different afterwards, I would have not understood what they were talking about - that the honeymoon period was real.\n\nOf course, it seems perfectly reasonable that not everybody would have the experience that I had.",

Only silly religious dogma puts a stigma on divorce.",

        "text": "Maybe someone with more knowledge can correct me if I am wrong, but I looked up pre nup law a while back and I think a lot of people get them wrong. Prenups can say whatever you want them to. A prenup doesn\u2019t have to be (though it can) \u201cmy money is mine and yours yours and that\u2019s it\u201d. Prenups can also say \u201cwe will divide any assets in this manor\u201d and you can outline exactly how you want to divide assets in the case of divorce in anyway you want. \n\nSo I actually agree with OP that every married couple should have one but for completely the opposite reason. If I am marrying someone in the near future, I am probably completely in love and care about that person more than any other time before that. \n\nThat to me seems like the perfect time to have a conversation more like \u201cbecause I care about you now, if things fail, I want to make that as easy as possible, avoid the long legal battle, and make sure you are going to be ok\u201d because if I grow to hate that person, my outlook on what I want out of the divorce may come from a source of revenge, and a prenup can also be used to prevent that, because it\u2019s already been agreed on. \n\nI do personally think that if your outlook is \u201cwell if we get divorced I don\u2019t want to lose the money I\u2019ve made\u201d then you shouldn\u2019t be getting married. A marriage is a partnership and more often than not, one party has to make sacrifices for the other and sometimes those sacrifices come in the form of finances. I just think a prenup can help prevent long legal battles and protect both parties, and protect against the idea of wanting to screw the other over in a divorce.",

I.E. No worries about interfaith marriage in a 100% Catholic country. \n\nI propose the bifurcation of these 2 things. If you want a religious ceremony, that is significant to you, then have that in your personal life. \n\nHowever, at least here in the states, we *intend* to treat everyone as equal in contract law. Therefore, I think what we conventionally think of as marriage should be \"Civil Partnerships\" where the \"government part\" is handled separately. And this contract is what you were discussing. I'm quite certain lawyers could get very skilled at boilerplate contracts for everything from division of assets, child-rearing, acceptable causes of divorce/contract disillusionment, asset splitting, ways to alter the contract, definition of cheating/lying/stealing/controlling, and anything else. I know this sounds clerical and administrative, but I would personally liked the experience to sit down with my ex-wife and clearly lay out what marriage would mean for her and I. \n\nI know nothing was actually stopping us from doing that in 20xx, but it was not a social norm do I didn't think if it until years later. Please forgive my bad judgement - I was 18 and defiantly in love to someone my shitty parents disapproved of. \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe other aspect of this is the contractual Civil Partner being required for all couples to get tax benefits, et al Then religious communities can limit marriage to their own dogmas,  as it is now just a societal practice and something for your in-group, without anyone getting preferential treatment in contract law.",

        "text": "They essentially already do, which is in the form of marital courts that handle divorces. Most of these have pretty set default positions in a divorce. Most prenups signed tend to deal with opinions or matters that go againts conventional court rulings. So for example, no fault divorce states may say that the cheating partner is not at fault in a divorce and thus is treated as if they did not cheat. You and your partner (upon marriage) agrees that this is bad, so you sign a prenup that says that if anyone gets caught cheating, they get nothing in the divorce. And the court cant go againts this. So on so forth. \n\n  \nLike you said, marriage is a contract. And most contracts can be performed verbally (i.e. sales and transactions in a walk in store) without need for an actual contract because the terms and conditions are pretty much agreed upon or understood by the average reasonable person. So for instance... you walk into a store, you see the product and the price, you pick up the product and pay for it, then leave. That's the contract. The seller is not required to communicate to you verbally or provide you with a quotation addressed to you on the price of their products, because that communication is considered to have occurred when they put the product up for display with a price tag and you looked at it. Your act of taking the product and proceeding to pay can be interpreted as consent to the price and agreement to proceed with the contract of transaction. No actual written contract necessary here, unless say.... you open a debit account with the store for example, and you pay for all your groceries taken from there in the period since you last paid. \n\n  \nProblem with prenups however is that they cannot account for any possible or potential changes in the marriage, or incidents that are outside of the expectations during the time period. So say... instances of abuses, neglect and so on. A poorly written or worded prenup is more dangerous than no prenups, because in the case of the latter, you still can rely on the courts to have a reasonable consideration of your situation. So imagine if your prenup says that the husband must be the sole breadwinner, and the wife is required to stay at home and care for the household. What happens if the husband meets an accident that cripples him, rendering him unable to work? That alone is enough to break the contract, forcing the marriage to split. \n\n  \nSo you mentioned kids and abusive parents. Okay lets talk about it. Do marriages and households have a reliable and trustworthy way to determine who is abusive and who isnt? And does this system account for all possible types of abuses? A lot of the abuses and mistreatments in marriages tend to go unreported, and there are many many ways to be abusive other than using physical force and leaving scars or bruises. How do you document all of them? Is the emotionally abusive mother better than the father who works two jobs and didint have time to spend with the family? Both of these leave no scars or marks on the kid, but both can have negative impacts on the child's development. How do you determine which of these is abusive, or even prove it? Can you leave it up to the kid to decide? What if the kid has been brainwashed? \n\n  \nSo all in all, I don't think prenups will fix much in marriages here. Especially given the modern views of marriages and the responsibilities that come with it. Most people nowadays cannot even list down the things in a marriage that are exclusive to people in a marriage. Prenups cannot fix that, because you probably cannot even put them into the prenup in the first place as a lot of these are considered to be politically incorrect to point them out.",

Prenups are nowhere close to a perfect solution, and having one will not guarantee an amicable divorce, esp the longer the marriage and if kids.\n\nPrenups cannot go against what state laws dictate, so no, most prenups do not go against conventional court rulings.  \n\nFor example...\n\nStates where infidelity is not a legal option for divorce (such as in no-fault states), any prenup that includes an infidelity clause will be voided. Only those states that allow divorce per infidelity will honor prenups that include it as a cause, and even then, it's not a guarantee the cheating spouse would get nothing.\n\nAlso, child support and custody cannot be included in any prenups in any of the 50 states.  \n\nPrenups are usually signed for protecting against liability for spouse's debt, esp if they have accumulated significantly more individual debt during the marriage than you; protecting act inheritance, investments or businesses, or future retirement/pension.  But to be clear, a prenup that lets one party keep most or all marital assets over the other, will usually be challenged in court, often successfully.",

If they can\u2019t get alimony, this forces them to stay in a relationship that\u2019s potentially unhealthy, abusive, toxic, maybe they\u2019re being cheated on, etc,. \n\nI agree that prenups should be far more common than they are now, especially if both people plan to work and come into the relationship with assets. That being said, alimony is there to protect people who can\u2019t work (those with disabilities, stay at home parents, etc) from staying in relationships they don\u2019t want to be in because their financial well-being is jeopardised. \n\nAlso, to add onto the infidelity bit: a lot of prenups can contain an infidelity clause, wherein, the unfaithful spouse is required to pay a sum of money or transfer some assets to the spouse who was cheated on. This is another reason why I feel prenups should be common, as it holds cheaters accountable.",

        "text": "Okay, I'm really going to throw you a unique perspective here... Many people see marriage as a religious institution that is only acknowledged & encouraged by the government for it's own ends (e.g. offspring, property, care benefits, etc.). Thus, a marriage ***is not*** a legal document, it is a very specific religious covenant that cannot be broken except under very specific circumstances. The contract people sign is an acknowledgement for the government so that it can justify & implement the marriage benefits. The government has simply coopted the word \"marriage\" to simplify the process. That is why people get so angry when people try to redefine what a marriage is.\n\nFor these people, a prenup is pointless because they made a binding covenant before God to fulfill their duties in a marriage. You may disagree, but to them a prenup falls below their religious convictions.\n\nAdditionally, there are many people who come from intact, positive, traditional nuclear families who marry each other. To them, their upbringing (seeing their family benefits vs the struggles of their friends) is often sufficient to rule out thoughts of divorce. Combine this with the religious component above, and you can easily understand why many people see no reason for a prenup.",

A major problem is the rules for alimony child support and distribution of property are based on where the divorce petition is filed rather than where the marriage occurred. This makes it difficult to say exactly what youre signing up for even if there is no prenup.\n\nRequiring prenups can be too costly for a lot of people and not everyone can afford them. There are lawyers and contracts that have to be written. More standard, simplified marriage terms might be better (eg checkboxes on marriage licenses) which would make prenup-esque options more available to the less well off couples. For example, checkboxes for community property or equitable distribution rules, alimony or no alimony, alimony formulas to be used, alimony types, how property is characterized (eg which property is separate and which is marital, how property can become marital property, which property stays separate, etc) Also explaining default marriage terms can be very helpful.",

    "text": "so, everyone ive said this to has told me im delusional, and i genuinely need to know if im wrong or not. basically, it all boils down to this: without excusing criminals' actions, theres always a reason for someone committing a crime no matter what it is, and if we can educate and help a person instead of punishing or killing them, its not only better for them, but for society as a whole. ive thought about it using three made-up examples:\n\nin a society where justice is a form of punishment, where a criminal goes to prison to be punished, they dont learn anything. they dont change for the better. especially when the punishment is made worse because of lack of prison reforms (looking at you, america. with your [82% reincarceration rate](https://bja.ojp.gov/news/justice-matters/desk-bja-november-2023#:~:text=A%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Justice,formerly%20incarcerated%20people%20were%20rearrested.)). so, when they get out, instead of getting a job or starting a family or anything else that's productive to society, of course they'll be more afraid of the justice system, so they'll just be smarter about the crimes they commit. they didn't learn anything, they probably come from a hard background so none of the punishment they experienced waa new to them, so they will never change. not only this, but you're not preventing the crime. you're just punishing the criminal.\n\nin a society where justice is killing every single criminal, of course you can discuss the ethics of this, but at the end of the day, it's the same thing. if you kill every criminal, you won't have stopped the crime from happening. if someone is in such a horrible place or state of mind that they take a life or hurt an innocent person, they most likely don't have anything to lose in the first place or they just don't care. so what's a death sentence gonna do? and if they're desperate enough, they'll do it anyway. and, that's IF they get caught. so again, it won't stop crime.\n\nbut, in a society where prisoners are rehabilitated instead of punished, where they can get an education and a degree, where they're not excused for their actions, but introduced to a whole different world and shown what love and empathy can bring you, then they most likely will never go back to a life of crime again. just look at the nordic countries, and compare their reincarceration rates to those of the USA. now, this will not only rehabilitate the prisoner, turn them into a working man or woman, and better their lives, but as a productive member of society, they will contribute to it. and if they decide to start a family, now you have a whole new generation of people raised with love and empathy, willing to better society. now, instead of worsening a life and affecting more people, or straight up taking a life and changing nothing, you'll have created not only one good person, but potentially two, three, four or more. of course life isn't this black and white, but if the majority of the criminal population gets bettered, it would be infinitely times bettee than worsening it or just not changing it. and by reforming most of the criminal population, crime starts to diminish and now you'll have prevented most crimes, which is way better than letting crime happen and just punishing the criminals, whilst doing nothing for the victim.\n\nthink of crime as a weed you want to get out of your garden. are you gonna cut it, and keep letting it grow just to cut it once more, or would you rather take it out by the root, and prevent it from growing again?\n\nTLDR: punishment as a form of justice, in my opinion, solves nothing, and does not prevent crime, whilst rehabilitation turns criminals into productive members of society, thus preventing most crime.",

That\u2019s important for social cohesion\n\n2: it\u2019s designed to keep the community safe from offenders, if they are locked away, they cannot harm more people. That\u2019s important for social cohesion. \n\n3: it\u2019s designed to act as a deterrent so that other people decide that the reward of committing crimes does not outweigh the risks and consequences. \n\n4: its designed to rehabilitate offenders to reintegrate into society after they serve their sentences. \n\nThe justice system has to balance all of these responsibilities equally. \n\nFor example let\u2019s just say that our hypothetical justice system is heavily geared towards deterrence, and therefore community safety as well. Criminals caught for the smallest infractions are locked away for life. Quickly that changed what we in the west would call a free society into a totalitarian one with ultimate government control. \n\nNow let\u2019s imagine a justice system that is heavily geared towards rehabilitation of criminals. This inadvertently means more second chances, shorter sentences, less public safety, less of a public sense of justice, and most importantly, less of a deterrence effect against future criminals. In Australia there is an issue right not where young criminals are getting let out 30-40 times after committing crimes, some of them have then gone on to murder people. This is a failure to protect the community, to deter the criminal and to serve justice. \n\nYou can see how you can start to run into problems. The justice system in various countries balance these in different ways. The Nordic model leans heavily on rehabilitation, but personally I have an issue with that kind of system. My analogy is that It turns the criminal into a sort of a main character with a beautiful story of how they became a better person, while the victims family is left to weep for their loss as a background character for the rest of their lives. That does not give me a sense of justice. It also costs a lot more in taxpayer funding to achieve this. \n\nPersonally there needs to be a good balance of all 4 facets of the justice system. Sense of justice, deterrence and community safety can all be achieved by decent sentencing and not too many second chances. While rehabilitation to return to society can be incorporated into the sentence served.",

        "text": "Your idealistic view completely ignores the reality of human nature and the victims' right to justice. I actually live in Norway, and while our rehabilitation system works for many offenders, it's not the perfect utopia you think it is.\n\nTake Anders Breivik - he murdered 77 people, mostly teenagers, in 2011. He's in a comfortable prison with a PlayStation and education opportunities. Has he shown any remorse or rehabilitation? No. He keeps making Nazi salutes in court and spreading his ideology. Some people are just evil and choose to be evil.\n\n> think of crime as a weed you want to get out of your garden. are you gonna cut it, and keep letting it grow just to cut it once more, or would you rather take it out by the root, and prevent it from growing again?\n\nThis metaphor is flawed. Humans aren't weeds - they have agency and make conscious choices. When someone deliberately tortures and kills a child, they're not doing it because of their \"background\" or lack of opportunities. They do it because they want to.\n\nThe point of punishment isn't just rehabilitation - it's also deterrence and protecting society. Your approach basically tells potential criminals \"go ahead, do whatever you want, worst case you'll get free education and therapy.\" That's a slap in the face to victims and their families.\n\nI agree the US system needs reform, but suggesting we should never use force or harsh punishment is dangerously naive. Some people need to be locked away permanently, not for rehabilitation, but because they're a threat to everyone else's safety.",

Your reply reminded me of the opening speech from No Country for Old Men, which I will post below:\n\n\"I was sheriff of this county when I was twenty-five years old. Hard to believe. My grandfather was a lawman. Father too. Me and him was sheriff at the same time, him in Plano and me here. I think he\u2019s pretty proud of that. I know I was.\n\nSome of the old-time sheriffs never even wore a gun. A lot of folks find that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough\u2019d never carried one. That\u2019s the younger Jim. Gaston Borkins wouldn\u2019t wear one up in Comanche County. I always liked to hear about the old-timers. Never missed a chance to do so.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but compare yourself against the old-timers. Can\u2019t help but wonder how they would\u2019ve operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the electric chair at Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion, but he told me there wasn\u2019t any passion to it. Said he\u2019d been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said if they turned him out, he\u2019d do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of that. I surely don\u2019t. The crime you see now, it\u2019s hard to even take its measure. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job\u2014not to be glorious. But I don\u2019t want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don\u2019t understand. You can say it\u2019s my job to fight it, but I don\u2019t know what it is anymore. More than that, I don\u2019t want to know.\n\nA man would have to put his soul at hazard. He\u2019d have to say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll be part of this world.\"",

Not all criminals are the same meaning not all rehabilitation is equivalent.

Rehabilitate the easy ones who haven't committed major crimes, kill the ones that are deemed to far gone. \n\n\nYou talk about teaching people to be good and empathetic. What if the person is a clinically diagnosed psychopath and can't feel emotion? How do you rehabilitate someone who is physically incapable of feeling remorse or guilt?",

    "text": "Ok not fixed on this at all, but watching Yellowstone currently (latecomer) and realizing how much the romanticized view of American rural independence and self-sufficiency is becoming increasingly outdated. I understand the importance in terms of identity, culture, and heritage. But also there\u2019s been a lot of inflow of wealth to rural land owners. If you have a ranch, you\u2019re no longer a cowboy, surviving on your own. You\u2019re a wealthy land owner. Also the access to luxuries has changed. You can live \u201coff the grid\u201d, but still afford a brand new Toyota Tacoma. You can live \u201cin the hills\u201d and now have a brand new flatscreen TV, often delivered by Amazon.  It makes sense why the populist backlash right now as the culture of \u201ccowboyism\u201d becomes increasingly threatened, but times just aren\u2019t the same. My family is from the hills of Appalachia, and we laugh about the tendency to horde things because it used to make sense when you didn\u2019t know when spare parts and things would make it to your town. It\u2019s just not like that anymore, and it feels increasingly like folks are clinging to a dying identity. The identity doesn\u2019t have to die though; it just needs to adapt. And i feel like it isn\u2019t admitting that times are changing and people do too. Anyways, curious if folks have some thoughts on whether the American idea of conservatism has merit as it is or, from my view, if it\u2019s in denial of the changing world around it from which it\u2019s already reaping the benefits\u2026\n\nEDIT: thanks for the engagement on this. Nice to see folks sharing perspective. Slight pivot after reading the comments, does \u201cconservatism\u201d have a way forward? Or does it inherently cling to the past? And if so, what is the way forward through that?",

                "text": "The US is militarily and often culturally dominant, but a lot of its wealth derives from the the use of the dollar and the position of New York as the hub of global finance. China and the EU are its equals in manufacturing (China has climbed the value ladder really quickly). The US is the great consumer - electronics from Taiwan, clothing from Bangladesh and Vietnam, software from India, anything mid-level from China (and sometime high level - eg solar tech and batteries). If it withdraws US wealth crashes even as others hurt.\n\nA second point is that the current brand of US conservatism is deeply hostile to science. That's another pillar of US strength - but again one where isolationism would hurt the US as much ore more than the rest of the world. Being mired in denial in the face of climate change is not a strength.",

        "text": "American rural values aren't just about physical survival or material self-sufficiency - they're about maintaining independence from institutional control and preserving local decision-making. The fact that ranchers can afford trucks or TVs doesn't invalidate their lifestyle or political views.\n\nI live in rural Montana and our community consistently pushes back against federal overreach on issues like land use, water rights, and education. We're not \"pretending\" to be self-sufficient - we're actively fighting to maintain control over our lives and resources. The wealth you mention actually helps us do this more effectively.\n\nThe \"dying identity\" you describe is actively growing in many ways. Remote work during COVID led to massive migration to rural areas. Many people are explicitly rejecting urban dependency, starting homesteads, and learning traditional skills - not because they have to, but because they want to.\n\nLook at the explosion of homesteading content on social media, the rise of local food movements, and the growing distrust of centralized systems. These aren't remnants of the past - they're contemporary responses to real problems with globalization.\n\nGlobal supply chains failed us during COVID. Food prices are skyrocketing. Big tech companies are censoring speech. The \"outdated\" values of local resilience and independence are more relevant than ever. Being conservative doesn't mean rejecting all change - it means being selective about which changes we embrace.",

At some level being a responsible person is acknowledging no man is an island and nobody it's truly independent. We all affect each other even if it's indirectly or unintentionally.\n\nPeople talk about being self made and personal responsibility, but personal responsiblity is not just about supporting yourself financially, being responsible is also being conscientious about how your actions affect others, about how the way you live and the way you make money affects the environment and other people.\n\nThe reality is your actions can affect people you never see. Land use, water rights, these are regulated because we already tried a world without them in the past. It was pretty terrible, people had unsafe working environments, people sold products unsafe to the customer, species were hunted to extinction, pollution harmed peoples health. These aren't hypotheticals. We know this because we tried a world without this stuff, it was horrible.\n\nAmerican conservatism seems to want to be \"personally responsible\" for making their wealth however they want but not want to be held accountable for the results of that that don't personally affect them or held to any standards.\n\nThere's nothing responsible about not caring about the long term and wide reaching effects of irresponsible land use and water use.",

Unfortunately that nuance is lost in our immediate gratification, social media saturated world.\n\nThere's a quote attributed to Albert Einstein \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\" I extend that to \"we can't solve problems with the same language that created them\". If you spend time talking to conservatives, and liberals for that matter, and slowly build trust and establish a shared pool of meaning there far more nuanced.

I often compare the United States to a dysfunctional marriage. If you're married and your partner holds an idea about how the world works that creates an imbalance in the relationship you typically have three choices. You can dig into the nuance and figure out how to talk about the issue until it's resolved (which can take years), you can live together in bitter resentment usually engaging in passive aggressive bickering or you can get a divorce (in most cases creating a tremendous amount of suffering especially when kids are involved). As a country if we don't dig into the nuance we are stuck with bitter passive aggressive stonewalling that has us collectively stuck and unable to really move forward. Every 4-8 years the government changes and the side that is no longer in charge does its best to stonewall anything. That's going to continue happening until we dig into the nuance or something snaps and things get seriously violent on a massive scale.\n\nAll that being said I wonder if, when talking about human rights we are actually talking about the same things. How do you define a right?",

Hell the whole globalization trend was mostly a neolib attempt to kick the can down the road when it came to the failures/inequalities of capitalism. Boosting a stagnating economy by exploiting foreign labor, goods and resources on the cheap. The USA is likely to become isolationist one way or another, along with much of the rest of the world. Countries will put up the fences and try to hold on to what they have. Conflict, borders and increased self sufficiency are likely to see a return. Globalization and global trade has been heavily reliant on cheap fossil fuels, and therefore probably a stupid/broken system in the first place.\n\nI personally foresee people becoming even more extreme hoarders in this future when it comes to long lasting quality goods as it becomes more and more impractical/expensive to constantly replace cheap chinese crap. There are already signs of this, with some farmers reverting to keeping old equipment rather than deal with the bullshit of corps like John Deer, the sales of new smart phones somewhat stalling etc. I seriously think the city dwellers who have become accustomed to extreme levels of waste and a profligate lifestyle with \"Everything at your finger tips\" are in for a rude awakening in the next 20 years.",

Big difference, if often misunderstood. Conservatives don't need a leader, which is also misunderstood, but they do need candidates to get elected. \n\nI'm honestly not sure which Catholic Lawyer you think is the leader of American conservatives. Which is interesting, because I am easily classified as conservative, although I despise Trump because he's not a conservative by our standards.",

When I say \"peak liberal\", I mean peak American influence where you can invade and bomb countries for not being \"liberal enough\" with no consequences.\n\nWithout American liberalism literally bombing third world countries and using economic sanctions to bankrupt global south nations, these traditionally conservative non-white humans (ie the other 90% of the planet) are not going to adopt white liberal values, plain and simple. \n\nTrump's win is a measure of how much white influence has waned globally, how much non-white countries are now unwilling to put up with American BS, and how expensive it is for the US to continue bombing and sanctioning.",

I want to understand what you are saying but that doesn't make any sense to me.   \n  \nI agree with you if you are using liberal to mean liberal social values, which I really don't care about nearly as much as left wing economic values, but usually when Americans say liberal they mean left wing politics broadly and to say that has been limited to America and Europe is just wrong when you factor in economic policy. \n\nTo me it just looks like global inflation has caused a global trend away from whoever has been in power recently which makes a lot of sense. The only country that has really bucked the trend of incumbents losing ground is Mexico which is one of the few countries on earth that has recently had a left wing populist president so I don't think the picture you are painting is really capturing everything that's going on.",

Because of this, much of our population is lined along the oceans. This frees up a LOT of land for the \u201cromanticized\u201d people of the \u201cAmerican rough-country.\u201d \n\nThis means that we are both:\n\n- In the position to affect change globally, and\u2026\n\n- Insusceptible to being affected by similar means.\n\nWe can enact trade blocks, tariffs, and SIGNIFICANT strike mobilizations, all while those will have no MEANINGFUL impact when enacted on us.\n\nThe US has enough food, clean water, oil, and other natural resources to completely cut ourselves off from the world, with the only downside being no more cheap crap from online stores like Wish or Temu. The only reason we IMPORT any of these is because of long-standing trade agreements that we decide to follow.\n\nTo follow this, there is zero way to effectively INVADE America. Taking into account American topography, as well as population data, it comes out to this on either side:\n\n1- Large population centers and naval bases. Over 50% of the population here owns firearms, and is VERY proficient in an urban setting.\n\n2- Hillbillies in uncrossable mountain ranges that have enough guns and explosives to arm most NATO allies\n\n3- Miles and miles of open land and untamed forests, filled with people who LLVE to train with weapons and have a SEVERE distrust of anything not red white and blue, not to mention most of the significant military assets owned by the United States, enough privately-owned bunkers to house the entire U.S. population 50 times over, all the major farmland, and NORAD.\n\n4- Same as 3, but now God has it out for you. Tornadoes and major natural disasters occur DAILY in this area, and it is BELOVED to those living here.\n\nAmerica is, essentially, a sleeping bear. Our rural independence gives us the position to be an unstoppable force, and fall back to the IMMOVABLE OBJECT. \n\nIn a world that is slowly starting to withdraw to hard boundaries, sticking with rural independence isn\u2019t just valid, it\u2019s ahead of the curve.",

For instance, say you\u2019re a Soviet functionary in 1991 trying desperately to keep the union together. You would be a conservative in that case, even though what you\u2019re trying to uphold is a communist system (nominally left wing and *not* conservative by any traditional definition). Meanwhile a reformer who is trying to implement a regime that sells off and privatizes public assets and opens the country\u2019s veins to the international financial system (which we might broadly associate with conservative economics) is the liberal. \n\nRe: immigration, republicans used be more lax on the issue because it was good for business (cheaper labor) while the labor component of the democratic coalition (such as it may have existed) was more anti immigration for the same reason. \n\nPublic opinion and social mores are always in flux, and what is considered conservative or liberal in relation to that changes too. Conservative ideology could easily tip into being anticapitalist in reaction to the pressures put on traditional family life by the demands of the market. Maybe it will wind up there, it\u2019s not inconceivable. But then you\u2019d had a version of conservatism significantly at odds with a past version. Many such cases.",

It uses deception and regressive tactics to maintain social inequality and justify its dominance\n\nConservatives claim to protect institutions, but only those reinforcing their power and  advocates for a societal hierarchy led by the elite, opposing egalitarianism and redefines \"freedom\" to align with control by elites while limiting civil liberties\n\nConservatism undermines democracy, conscience, reason, and language. It manipulates public perception through sophisticated public relations and rhetorical strategies. \n\nThe Trump administration has already lied about project 2025 and is setting us up for a kakistocracy - government by the least suitable or competent citizens of a state. Additionally, and worse, some of those unqualified persons have already signaled acting on vengeance and abuse of power towards those that would stand up to their actions or disagree with their politics.\n\nLastly, look at Trump's Thanksgiving post on social media -  what a complete and utterly disgraceful person, untif to be the head of a so-called great nation. But this is only the next piece of evidence that the willfully ignorant continue to ignore.",

Anyhow, the issue with Trumps administration is that they claim to want to break away from the elites, but they're empowering elites of their choice. Look at Elon Musk, a billionaire who has a vested business interest in space industries, has direct input on the government's allocation of funds regarding space. Several of Trump's picks, have ties to project 2025 being authors, including Russell Vought, Brendan Carr, Tom Homan. Project 2025 is basically a policy list, which a group of conservatives would like to impose. They would like to strengthen the powers of the President, replacing all civil servants with those subservient to the president, removal of workers rights and protections etc.",

In addition there\u2019s dozens of potential conflicts brewing that could go off in a chain reaction with each subsequent conflict increasing the likelihood of Pax Americana coming to a swift and violent end for some time.\n\nThe Russia/China/Iran axis have gathered a cabal of dictators and proxy groups like North Korea, Venezuela, All of Irans terrorist proxies, Russian mercenary backed dictators in Africa, etc\u2026\n\nThese belligerent regimes have increasingly showed their willingness to disrupt the global peace which has been enforced by the NATO coalition in the West.\n\nRussia is in open conflict, Europe is increasingly less neutral, which is a very noteworthy development in some cases. China is poised to challenge US hegemony, which would be very disruptive to stability.\n\nThe US acts as the guarantors of global peace, so the more conflicts there are the more they have to divide their focus, which creates gaps for potential belligerents to exploit, each additional conflict increases the likelihood of more conflicts, and then BOOM, WW3.\n\nIt\u2019s very pre-WW2 like circumstances we\u2019re living in, the continuity of globalization should be the least of our worries.\n\nGlobalization is on borrowed time, but maybe we can broker some kind of peaceful coexistence among regional powers.

I once read an essay that asked the question of what kind of society a liberal might be conservative in. At some point, the world you\u2019re in has to have more in common with your children than the brands we consume. The world is changing too quickly, leaving some to either romanticize the past in order to cling to it or refuse until they just acquiesce and adopt newer customs. This is not conservatism though.",

It\u2019s not as if America was forced to enter into this world order, quite the contrary, the world was forced to adopt it by America. Now that the benefits of this system seem to be reaching its climax, our reserve currency status is being challenged and regular American feel they are getting the short end of the stick, populism is back on the table. This isn\u2019t some deviation, this is america coming back into the natural equilibrium it\u2019s held historically.",

Then you have other LGBTIA+ members who have finally been able to live somewhat of a life and then you have the greedy old billionaires who make money off the backs of poor people... they don't think about that though what they think about is everything was great in this next time but most of the time when they're talking about that time it was when there was a high tax rate on the wealthy. Nobody ever said that thinking was their strong suit but at the same time you obviously can tell that these people do not do their own research they just pair it what they're told on right wing media which has been proven to lie time and time again. And another reason why they don't like college is because it opens up people's minds to all the closed negativity that they were forced to live under with their conservative parents. Conservatives don't want to move forward and welcome everyone into the fold they only want to be the superior beings again where everybody had to be separate. Just listen to what they say and especially Trump. He is uttering people and he is promising to go after non-white people. In this day and age it's way better to be a progressive than a conservative. Progressives recognize and realize that we are all human and we all need to be included in the equation to determine how we all can live happy lives as well as keep our country running honorably.",

    "text": "Edit: I HAVE ALREADY CHANGED MY MIND I CANT GET TO EVERY RESPONSE THANKS\n\nThis is a view I would like changed because, well, I would like to actually enjoy entertainment. However, I can't help but think that the entire industry is a giant distraction, draining resources and time away from actual causes. Let me explain:\n\nPoint #1: ***Too much resources go to the entertainment industry.*** This point is pretty simple to prove. According to ZipRecruiter, the average salary of a doctor in the US is about $110k to 160k per year. Now, let's check the average salary, of, say, an actor. We could use any actor, but let's go with....David Tennant, one of the Doctors. According to Market Realist, his salary is about $2.9 million. It doesn't specify a timerange but that is STILL a lot more than the yearly figure of an actual doctor. A guy who plays a character known as the Doctor gets a LOT more money than somebody who's job is to actually prevent people from dying. And a lot of these people who get paid aren't even good people! See: Kanye West, Chris Brown, Drake, Taylor Swift with her carbon jet. I don't like this. It's not just money either. Do you KNOW how much plastic and rubber the entertainment industry uses? Both are finite resources by the way, being made out of oil and natural gas.\n\nPoint #2: ***The entertainment industry is way too distracting to real world issues.*** Yes, it SUCKS talking about politics but we kind of need to do SOMETHING about the growing divide, racism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. But nobody cares because holy shit GRAMMIES and holy shit BASKETBALL. And while I don't have as clear-cut of an argument here, look at the March on Washington. Most people couldn't be ASSED to do  anything similar nowadays because people are too busy being content and pacified with entertainment, and if you bring it up, you just look like a Negative Nancy who's ruining Thanksgiving dinner/game night/whatever.\n\nCounterpoint: ***Entertainment is the expression of art.*** Oh really? What if I told you the industry is actually REALLY unfair to actual creators. I don't even have to bring up the various strikes, nor do I have to bring up the use of AI. [All I have to do is point out the fact that Executive Meddling is an actual trope on TV Tropes and by GOD the amount of examples is huge.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling) But if you want a specific example, Alex Hirsch, the creator of Gravity Falls, had to censor a large part of the show just because of S&P. If entertainment is supposed to be for people to express their art, it is a TERRIBLE place for that as your art will just be censored, sanitized, and bastardized.\n\nCounterpoint: (this point was moot from the start and I dont like it, and its VERY easily disproven. Look to the comments if you want to know what this point was)",

The Great Depression got us the New Deal, where the idea of human security (as articulated in the [Four Freedoms speech](https://www.fdrlibrary.org/four-freedoms)) formed the basis of the Atlantic Charter, or how the influence of freedom would unfold in the aftermath of the war.  One major idea of human security as stated in the Four Freedoms is that poverty is antithetical to a free society and there existed a campaign to eliminate poverty domestically in the US and abroad.  I think we\u2019ve lost sight of that vision.  We focus too much on the \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d and not enough on the \u201cfreedom from want.\u201d  And so this isn\u2019t because of the entertainment industry. The entertainment industry is a symptom and not the cause.  The disease is a lack of temperance of capitalism and not capitalism itself.  Lack of temperance of any system would also yield bad outcomes.",

I\u2019m not really sure why you are so concerned with Disney movies, but sure, let\u2019s look at Toy Story, Monsters Inc, the original Avengers movie or Iron Man 1. \n\nYour claim that Back to the Future is more universally acclaimed than modern movies is ironic, as every single movie I have mentioned is about as critically acclaimed by both a critical and an audience standpoint as Back to the future. The Dark Knight and Breaking bad, in particular, both have WAY more critical acclaim than back to the future or Jurassic park. And are you really gonna tell me that back to the future 2 and 3 were NOT cash grabs?\n\nAlso, I think that in the modern day, people are generally more likely to share their (especially unfavorable) opinions. This is not necessarily a reflection of the quality of movies that exist, but rather a reflection of the fact that social media exists. If this post was specifically about the Entertainment industry as it pertains to social media, then you would have overwhelming support from most people on this view, but the entire entertainment industry is not a legitimate claim.",

        "text": "This is a weird one. I can't speak to your overall point about resources and salaries, because the problem you have is economics. These things aren't allocated resources by the state. At least not for the most part. They're spending resources they got by selling things that people bought. If we lived in a soviet style planned economy I might see your point, but this is a capitalist free market and that's just how it works. What is your proposed alternative?\n\n\nSecondly, your point about the quality of entertainment is a little weird. No, Jurassic Park was not loved by everyone when it came out. It was very popular, but a lot of people didn't like it.\n\n\nToday we live in a world where everyone is empowered to publicly display their opinion on everything. This makes it seem like movies are more divisive than they used to be, when in reality it's just that people who didn't like popular things find it easier to find like minded people and everyone's opinions are being amplified and publicised to a greater degree. The Internet also makes these opinions seem more universal than they are.\u00a0\n\n\nTake the star wars sequels, for instance. If you only pay attention to the internet, the first two are, depending on who you talk to, either the best in the franchise or so bad they could only have been written by a chimpanzee. But almost every time they come up when I talk to people who don't spend much time online, the reaction is \"yeah they where pretty ok\".\u00a0\n\n\nDo you think the average cinema goer watching moana 2 has strong opinions on the pacing or character work? No, because they average viewers are 8 year old kids and their parents. The kids think everything is amazing and the parents just want their kids to like it. And that's always been the primary demographic for Disney movies. The kids will grow up and remember it just as fondly you remember your favourite kids film, and the parents will forget it the second they step out the cinema.\n\n\nSo no, movies are not less enjoyable than they used to be to the average person, and I find it weird that you try to use, like, the prevailing opinion on reddit as representative of the general public. And, for the record, there are plenty of movies and shows I would consider very good coming out all the time.\n\n\nYou talk about corporate franchise shlock as if its a new thing, and yeah, media corporations have definitely been embracing established franchises more than in the past, but that's just the way the market is trending. Holywood is going where they think the money is, because that's what they've literally always done. Right now it's big franchises and remakes, in the future we might see a trend back towards more independent stuff. In the past, funding a multi-part movie franchise based on a pre-existing IP was seen as a massive risk (see all the behind the scenes madness it took to get lord of the rings made as an example), but now it's the safest bet imaginable.\u00a0\n\n\nAre actors overpaid for their labour? I mean quite possibly, but they're not paid for their labour. They're paid for brand recognition. And if you have an issue with that then fine, but that's just capitalism baby. Pretty much every issue you've highlighted is just \"I don't like when people make movies as a business\", and that is an extremely valid opinion to have, but in your ideal world how do you change that?",

Until the viewers go away the industry will always have a mechanism to thrive. But if no one watches what the entertainment industry provides there will be no demand and thus supply will dry up.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the other way around. Some enterprising individuals will always fill in the gap when there is a lack of supply, but high demand. This could take the form of homemade productions, or some outside of the mainstream entertainment industry. YouTube comes to mind particularly. This better be long enough or I will be sad.\n\nFurther Edit:\n\nI can't dumb supply and demand down any further so I will devolve into meaningless drivel here. Please any reader of this magnificent work please pause and give me many downvotes. I shall collect them and add them too my hoard, for I love downvotes. Perhaps an essay will be long enough for the delta bot, or no, perhaps a book. I'm really not sure these days. What is the required word count?\n\nWho knows is this long enough\n\nFurther Edit: \n\nWhy in the world must I write an essay for a silly delta. This will be the end of me lol. Please someone help me get this delta. This will be sad if someone sees this. Word. Word. Word. Long enough now? Gahhh.",

I share that part with you. \n\nNow that I understand your view a little better, here\u2019s how I think it should be adjusted a bit. \n\nI think you should pivot from blaming the industry and move instead to an argument of personal responsibility.  Because excessive wealth in the entertainment industry is no different than excessive wealth in any other industry, such as the energy economy.  Maybe the industry needs more regulation, and maybe it doesn\u2019t.  But even if you wipe out all of Hollywood, people would just find some other way of wasting time. So, change your view away from the industry.  People are people. \n\nThe second way I\u2019d like to challenge your view is to consider people are in different spaces. \n\nConsider a social worker or nurse who works 8-12 hours a day.  They come home, cook for their families, spend a little time together, and have 45 minutes to unwind as they are getting ready for bed so they can do it all again tomorrow.  Is it really so wrong to have Netflix running in the background as they gather their clothes and other items together so they can be ready for work the next day?  The entire rest of the non-sleeping day is devoted to others.  \n\nContrast this with someone with more leisure time.  Sure, they should volunteer or something. \n\nThere are lots of good people in the world already doing what you expect.  Don\u2019t be so hard on people.",

        "text": "Your argument falls apart when you look at basic human psychology and history. Entertainment isn't some modern waste - it's literally how humans have always processed reality and maintained mental health. Even in concentration camps, prisoners put on plays. Ancient civilizations had theater when they barely had running water.\n\nThe salary comparison is meaningless. The average actor makes $35k/year - you're cherry-picking celebrities. And doctors aren't hurting - the median physician salary is actually $339k, not $110k. Your numbers are way off.\n\nThe \"distraction from real issues\" argument makes zero sense. The civil rights movement happened during peak Hollywood golden age. BLM protests happened while Netflix was huge. Entertainment often DRIVES social change - look at how Will & Grace helped normalize gay relationships, or how Get Out sparked conversations about racism.\n\n>Name a single movie or TV show that people universally enjoyed within recent times\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once. Succession. Ted Lasso. Breaking Bad. These shows are critically acclaimed AND commercially successful. Just because YOU don't enjoy modern entertainment doesn't mean it's objectively bad.\n\nAnd regarding artistic expression - for every censored show there are thousands of indie productions and streaming series pushing boundaries. There's more creative freedom now than ever before. Gravity Falls still got made and was successful despite the censorship you mentioned.\n\nYou're basically arguing that because some parts of the industry are problematic, the whole concept of entertainment is wasteful. That's like saying we should abolish restaurants because McDonald's exists. It's an absurd leap in logic.",

        "text": "This post represents a simplistic view of the impact of the entertainment industry. Money is invested in the entertainment industry because it is anticipated that the return will be greater than the sum invested. \n\nThat investment creates jobs, which provides salaries for workers and tax revenues for the government, which contributes to funding important social programs. \n\nOne can argue that governments should change how they allocate funding for social programs, but it\u2019s a reality that the government needs a supply of revenue in order to fund those programs. Revenue is also required to look at things like foreign aid as well. \n\nBy killing off the entertainment industry, that gets rid of jobs, places more people onto government assistance and reduces incoming tax revenues. This makes the nation poorer.\n\nPeople working in non-essential industries like entertainment are still providing goods and services which are desired within the economy which contributes to productivity - which has a positive impact on controlling inflation and creating jobs, which is good for average prosperity. \n\nMost people do not have the cognitive or physical capacity to work on complex problems after doing a full week\u2019s work. This is not a derogatory statement about humanity, but just a recognition that most people have to dedicate the majority of their energy to themselves, their families, and maybe their direct community. \n\nI\u2019m not convinced that removing entertainment media from people\u2019s lives would incline them towards dedicating that time to worthy causes. The more likely outcome is just people swapping one form of recreation for another, perhaps a healthier one, but most people aren\u2019t going to become activists as a replacement for watching Love Island.",

So I don't really get the argument for \"well fuck it it had a good run time to put it down\".\n\nOn the corporate meddling point I agree it's bad but it's not a new development what' is a New development is you seeing articles and videos about stuff like movies being reshoot or delayed or behind the scenes people get hired or replaced once again it's not good but it's not unusual in fact examples from the past we found out about way after the fact are in usually far worse.",

Succesful actors or NBA players are much less in number than doctors or teachers. Yes, people like TS or KW can be more eco-conscious but people respond to the cost-benefit calculus. They can afford a jet, their time is scarce so they spend money on it. Even if the government puts a carbon tax, these people would still use jets and live a carbon-intensive life because they can just afford it. The bigger picture is to make them pay for carbon abatement through a policy, but that is for the people to demand and the government to legislate. \n\n\\>Point #2:\u00a0***The entertainment industry is way too distracting to real world issues.***\n\nThere are so many posts on Reddit about too much diversity and LGBTQ+ issues being incorporated in movies and shows. Star Wars fans got pissed about that couple years ago. On the whole, I think the industry is pretty progressive, even though some instances look like token messaging. \n\n  \nThe US, as the election just showed, is majority regressive, misogynistic, homphobic and racist. I would say the Hollywood is doing a great job not pandering to the nuts in these difficult times.",

Germany, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, America, and others have been heavily criticized fir their roles in such atrocities (for good reason) and have paid reparations, educated their populaces, and made sure that their actions would be remembered.\n\nBut how about Japan? The first thing most think of when I use that word is anime ~~girls~~. They paid reparations, sure, and made some public apologies, but continue to allow imperial-sympathetic groups into their government and honor their war criminals. They flooded the Philippines with Japanese culture to make younger Filipinos more sympathetic to Japan. Or Turkey? Their (and their neighbors to the south and east) government and populace continue to deny the Late Ottoman Genocides and promote Turkish Nationalist sentiments in the government. Or China? Or the suppression of minorities in all of South and Southeast Asia?\n\nAt least here in the US, we don't learn about any atrocities outside of the Holocaust and the Trail of Tears, and its criminal.",

They also largely get away with denying and deflecting the shit they did and at least in America way fewer people are aware of what happened in Asia during ww2 vs Europe.\n\nThe Japanese are certainly less aware of what they did in ww2 than Germany is IN SPITE OF MODERN GERMANY NOT EVEN BEING THE SAME NATION IN MANY REGARDS.

It's not ok but neither is war itself. Only positive thing I can say is we seem like we might be moving away from it.",

The ones that would know enough to give America crap know enough to give all of your examples - China, Japan, Turkey - crap too.\u00a0\n\nAsk 50 Americans, Germans, and Brits educated enough to be up to date on the politics of their country, who the Turks genicided in WW1. Or who the Chinese are geniciding right now. Or what countries the Japanese screwed over.",

As is the Rwandan genocide, just to add.\u00a0\n\nEveryone and their nan knows about the Uighurs - it was the BBC\u2019s favorite talking point, with 4 articles a day, for a couple of years not so long ago. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that, were you to go to the BBC News \u201cChina\u201d section, there\u2019s probably a Uighur article now.\u00a0\n\nWho the fuck doesn\u2019t know about Japan in Korea and China? You know what, fuck it. I want to suggest *you* don\u2019t know.\u00a0\n\nAll your criticism of Japan seems to be aimed at WWII. You know they did all their evil shit before that, too? They were invading Korea before 1600. They did a lot of abhorrent things on the continent even back then.\n\nOn comfort women; it\u2019s always painted as some kind of exceptionalism, that the Japanese thought the Chinese and Koreans inferior and thus put them into sexual slavery. That\u2019s.. not really true. For one, a lot of the \u201ccomfort women\u201d started as prostitutes - though not necessarily of their own volition. A lot were bought from their parents; a lot were promised payment that never came; and a lot were the genuine sex slaves forced into military brothels without any background to it.\n\nOn buying people for brothels; did you know the Japanese were still doing that to their own women up until after the war? The selling of rural daughters to whorehouses only stopped when the Allied occupiers outlawed prostitution entirely (bar the exception carved out for bath houses).\u00a0\n\nI think, even on your pedestal, you aren\u2019t really aware of the things you decry others not knowing.\u00a0\n\nHeck, look at the samurai. A honorable warrior race, right? Not really. The reality was that most were degenerate gamblers, chronic alcoholics, what we would not consider \u201chomeless\u201d and on state welfare - the bushido wasn\u2019t enshrining a pre-existing Samurai culture, it was an attempt to forcibly correct the disarray of the Samurai reality.\n\nSorry to pick on Japan in particular; it\u2019s just the history I actually read in University. I realize the Ottomans have a much greater history of barbarity, too; the Armenian genocide doesn\u2019t even stand out in Ottoman history, other than being the most recent example. There was mass rapes and baby stealing in Spain by their predecessor; the Ottomans directly were taking children as political hostages then buggering the child. The prophet himself was raping an 8 year old, towards whom he proved his piety by waiting until his 6 year old bride bled to fuck her - limiting himself to intercrural sex with the toddler until then.\u00a0",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because they support drone striking children - rather they\u2019re too uninformed to know that\u2019s what their precious Obama was doing.\u00a0\n\nOP\u2019s making it comparative by specifying non-western governments. Apparently western governments get the correct amount of shit for their crimes - but the west are the only ones that celebrate rather than prosecute their war criminals.\n\nObama walks free from assassinating children with blatant disregard for civilian life. Blair and Bush walk free after prosecuting an illegal war. Truman is free after ordering the two nuclear strikes, while having been offered a conditional surrender- with that condition being voluntarily maintained by the Americans upon Japan\u2019s unconditional surrender.\n\nHeck, on Truman; he constantly re-estimated how many lives he saved as the horrors of the bombs came to light - horrors he should have been prosecuted for on a second count, as the \u201caid\u201d sent actually used the victims as human experiments. They didn\u2019t try to help or alleviate radiation sickness, the doctors sent to \u201chelp\u201d studied the Japanese as they died in excruciating pain.\u00a0",

So the further away you get from western culture the more the foundational ethics upon which attrocities were justified look alien and can feel like you're talking out your ass when you criticize them.\n\nEg. Most countries will agree that slavery is bad. But do they believe so because its mean? Because there's something sacred about freedom? Because people are their own property? There's multiple ways to get from point A to point B, but the path you take to get there will influence what the edge cases look like. (It's not slavery because [they aren't really people] [they forfeited their rights by commiting X crime] [they're just working off their debt])\n\nIt can be daunting to speak with any moral authority over people you don't really understand. And imposing one's ideas of right and wrong over people they don't understand lies at the root of at least half the shit we criticize countries for having done in the first place.",

After WW2 the west tried to lay out a system of international law, trade and peace (again, not without a fair bit of hypocrisy and violence). \n\nI realize that all of these achievements come after decades or even centuries of blood and evil, but all we can do is try to move forward. \n\nMy point is, you don\u2019t see a lot of nations in the world that are as accepting and open as western nations.

        "text": "Actually, you're looking at this through a very narrow lens. The reason western countries get more criticism is precisely because they've had the power to shape global narratives and institutions. Japan literally had two nuclear bombs dropped on it and was occupied for years - their war criminals were tried and executed at Tokyo trials. Their \"sympathy groups\" are fringe elements with minimal power, unlike the very mainstream Confederate sympathy that still exists in the US.\n\nThe US still has military bases all over the world and actively interferes in other nations' politics. When's the last time Japan invaded another country? Meanwhile, we've been in Iraq, Afghanistan, and have bases in like 70 countries.\n\nLook at how current events are covered - when Russia invades Ukraine, it's all over western media. When Saudi Arabia bombs Yemen? Barely a peep. That's not because non-western countries get away with more - it's because western media and institutions control the narrative.\n\nPlus, your examples are cherry-picked. South Korea has successfully prosecuted former dictators. Taiwan publicly addresses its authoritarian past. Vietnam teaches extensively about the My Lai massacre.\n\nThe real issue isn't that non-western countries don't get enough criticism - it's that we're so focused on other countries' crimes that we ignore our own ongoing ones. Like, we're literally selling weapons to Saudi Arabia right now while they're bombing civilians in Yemen.",

It is a country asking its allies to assist it in a civil war against a terrorist insurgent group.\n\nTo compare assisting a neighbor in their anti-insurgency campaign to a full on imperialist war of aggression aimed at conquering your neighbor is absurd.",

The Holocaust and the Trail of Tears aren't being covered because they're the most important or deserve the most attention, it's because there's a section on Early American history and another on World War history, and those are the genocides that come up along the way.\n\nIn order to teach about other atrocities, more time would need to be spent on other countries in general. Let's say we want to teach about some of the atrocities in the Ottoman Empire. First, there would need to be an Ottoman Empire section being taught in history, probably a world history course. How much time can be dedicated to one country? Let's give it two one-hour classes, which seems pretty generous for one empire (that isn't Rome *sigh*) in a world history course. One class is probably a political/military history, covering the entire Ottoman Empire, how it's run, how it expanded, and how it fell. The next class can be culture and society. How much of that limited time should be dedicated to atrocities, and how much to everything else that needs to be packed in?\n\nTl;dr, I think you're right that too much attention is given to American/Western atrocities, but that's a side effect of an American/Western focus overall.",

Only it\u2019s not even true that this is the brunt of criticism, since there are far more people who support the west wholly and will always hold more criticism for third world despots than they ever do their own countries.",

Giving preferential treatment to minorities who were disadvantaged by the crimes of people who are now dead is a form of trying to restore the advantages that were taken from them by the crimes and atrocities inflicted on their ancestors. Is it enough? Probably not.",

The civil rights act wasnt enacted and then with a snap of the fingers , all companies and financial institutions treated blacks equally. \ud83e\udd23\n\nTheir discrimination was allowed and backed by the federal government. And because of that behavior, minorities in this country did not have the same opportunity to build generational wealth. As a millennial my mother was affected  by this. Why were the Japanese given monetary reparations but not my black 91 year old grandmother, a generational black American?\n\n America wants to fight injustice all over the world but finds every excuse to not right the wrongs here. Even if I concede that almost no one is alive today who implemented any of these practices, it doesn\u2019t matter because the American government is still alive.\n\nIf you crash someone\u2019s car and you wanna make it right, you don\u2019t decide to just not crash their car anymore.

    "text": "There are many games for which people often make up their own rules when they don't like the rules stated in the game and I strongly dislike it. \n\nI talking about a wide range of games like board games, card games, etc. Most of them have someone who created it or an organization that creates the rules and this information can be found in the rule book or online. Obviously if you looked online and cannot find any information then you are free to decide but in many cases people just state they do not like certain rules and create their own rules. \n\nI am not saying there is any way to stop it, I am not saying to make it illegal and have cops arrest them for making their rules. I am just saying I dislike it when people do this and would strongly prefer if they did not. \n\nAlso I realize there are situations where it would be 'more fun' to have your own rules, but I think it is important to stick to the rules and play the games as intended by the people who created it. \n\n\n\nSome examples : \n\nUNO - many people have different variations on stacking, playing +2 on +2, +4 on +4, etc\n\nMonopoly - variations with different trading rules, different creating houses rules\n\nCards against humanity - variations with discarding your hand, different judging practices\n\n\n\nThere are games like Bluff which have been relatively informally passed down by generations and they do not have official rules like there are variations where you have to play a card, can pass on your turn, variations where the number increases or stays the same. I think the rules should be standardized for the game and then everyone should follow it. I am not sure about how exactly they would become standardized. But in the meantime I am fine with people being open about rules in this sort of situation. \n\n",

They have a lot of intricacies and the game designers probably considered different rules, and decided what are the best and the idea of people trying to make their own house rules in games is somewhat of a concern to me.",

For example, I play a fair bit of Japanese (Riichi) mahjong, and there are situations where it\u2019s easy to recognize what a player is trying to do (e.g. going for a chinitsu hand), and other players (especially that player\u2019s kamicha) shouldn\u2019t feed them. And most players who\u2019ve played a reasonable amount would know that. However if you throw a beginner into the mix, they\u2019d just unwittingly do so, and then you\u2019re at greater risk of dealing in because of that. So it just makes the experience worse.",

Personal choice plays no role in games, nobody can have a preference in which games they enjoy, there are set \"optimal\" games universally?\n\nEven if the creators agonized over the creation of a game's rules it doesn't mean they chose rules which the group of people playing it in that particular house most enjoy. Monopoly for example was conceived as a demonstration of the economic consequences of land value taxation and the neoclassical concept of economic rent.

                        "text": "> Talking to the game designers if there is a patent on taking their idea and just changing one part.\n\nYou cannot patent game rules. Across the board, period. You can have a copyright on a particular document explaining the rules such as a rule book you wrote up, but you have no claim on another game that uses the same rules.\n\nUnderstanding that, why do you think a different set of rules needs to be written down in a book before it can be followed? A game as an idea surely is just as reasonable and valid as one which is committed to paper.\n\nIf everyone knows how to play a game but you don't have a rule book do you have a problem with them playing?\n\n> There should a process instead of just saying lets change this rule cause I dont like it.\n\nThis sounds like... I dunno, autism? As you said, \"not that serious dude\", it is just a few people playing a game among themselves. Why should they need to write up a process document, apply for planning permission down at the courthouse, commission an impact study, etc. in order to play a game by their own rules? Why does there need to be \"a process\"?\n\n> When playing a game which has a given set of rules and just deciding hey I dont like this rule so lets play without it or change it, is just stupid to me.\n\n\"Stupid\" how exactly? Suppose for the sake of argument that the change makes the game more fun or enjoyable to the players. What is stupid about that? Yes it is different, but surely it is *better* right?",

                "text": "I think the reasons you have to dislike changes are the same reason people have to change things. \n\n>Like if we play Bluff with the numbers increasing and number staying the same, the game, strategy to approach it everything about it changes and it is no longer the same game. \n\nThat is kind of the point. If you play a lot of a game, quite often you can get good at it, or see the aspects that can be exploited, leading to certain dominant strategies. That can be fun to work out, but once you know the \"optimal\" way to play, the game can be a lot less fun. This is something you can see in video games a lot. Players find \"optimal\" strategies, which leads to repetitive, predictable games and reduced player satisfaction. To improve player satisfaction, the balance of the game, it's characters/items/interactions are adjusted, making overlooked options better and dominant strategies less oppressive. \n\nBy changing things, making it a new version of the game with new strategies, the game stays fresh, rather than becoming stagnant. \n\n>In almost every case, the people who created the game thought about the rules and have reasonings why they made the rules in the way they did and creating house rules feels disrespectful to them.\n\nI strongly disagree that it is disrespectful. Playing games has been a part of the human experience for millennia. From the beginning, people have made up rules, played with them, then passed on the information of what the game is and how to play to a new group, who in turn play the game, make adjustments and pass it on again. Creating and playing with those homebrew rules is just continuing the grand human tradition of playing games and adjusting them to fit the play group. \n\nIf you look back to the people who made the rules of any given game, it's almost always based on some other game or games that the people already enjoyed. The rules you now call \"official\" were once a homebrew that now became popular. \n\nThe game Bluff for examples goes by many names, and depending on where in the world you are, the rules vary immensely! The version you consider \"official\" is just the most popular version where you happen to live. The people who made the game you like were not being disrespectful when they made their version, so you are not being disrespectful when you play an altered version either. \n\n>I also think the people who created tested different versions and have the rules the way in the optimal way.\n\nThis just isn't the case. Games get tested, but optimal isn't really applicable here. You can try your best to test your game and it's rules, but you can't anticipate every situation. For example, I play chess with a friend with a motor neuron disease. He finds it difficult to move the pieces where he wants them, sometimes sliding the wrong one, or stopping in the wrong spot. We play with house rules that when we play, instead of your turn ending when you let go of your piece, it ends when you say that is your move. It's a small thing, but the rule change makes the game more accessible to him. The rules of chess work, but are not optimal for him. \n\nFor something like Uno, my friends and I enjoyed the game in the past, but things get a little dull in groups of more than 4, you make a turn and then wait around as everyone else draws, skips, reverses etc. The problem was we don't like that after someone's turn, they kinda zone out of the game or chat, which slows down play. So now, we added \"jump in\" rules to keep things more dynamic. If anyone plays a card that you exactly match (like a red 3), you can throw your copy in as well. There are also cards with added effects. 7s are heaven, last person to raise a hand draws a card, sometimes we add more. All these rules optimise the fun for our play group, making it more exciting to pay attention to other people's turns. \n\n**The developers of the game are not trying to make a \"perfect\" game, just the game that most people will be able to enjoy. By adding home rules, you can perfect the game for the people you are playing with.**",

Game design involves a lot of compromise. You have to balance what is most interesting and fun, against what is best for game balance, but perhaps even more importantly, what is feasible for the least-common-denominator audience of the game to learn in a couple of minutes. There are probably many games where the game designers recognize that a certain house rule or variation is actually better, but they didn't print it that way, because it's better to print something simple that everyone can learn in five minutes.",

I mean if a rule makes a game hard to understand then it should not be added in the game even by house rules. And if it does not make it much harder then the designers should have added it.",

            "text": "For example, if I meet someone new and we eventually play board games together, we have to make a compromise on some games, because they made up their own rules, and I didn't.\n\nWe will never play that game when both of us are 100% happy and satisfied with the rules, because they decided in the past that they know better how to play this game, over its own creators.\n\nThe single thing that defines what a game is is limitiation. In football you can't touch the ball with your hands, despite it would be easier. In poker, you can't just look through the whole deck and make yourself a royal flush to win every time, you have to hope and guess. You can't just throw away all your cards instantly in uno, you have to throw them away one by one, when your turn comes.\n\nTaking away limitations goes against the soul of games, making them actually less gamey. And giving in more limitations (rarer type of house rules) implies the person/party is much more experienced in the game than the average, so much so that they make up arbitrary rules to make it more and more difficult. This latter thing especially, but house rules altogether, go against the social and communal aspect of games.\n\nSet rules make it so you can play easily with every person who has played this game before, because they and you too know the rules on how to play. But if a group learned that you can use your hands in football, they can't really connect through the event of a shared game, because others don't play it like that. They can make compromises, but then at least one group, if not both, won't have as much fun as if they would play by their own rules.\n\nAlmost all games are social, made to play with others. Distancing yourself from others by making the rules not united across all people, goes against the soul of games",

A compromise would be to change some rules to the liking of the other party, but less of them than they would usually play, to appeal to me by staying relatively more normal rules than their version.\n\n>Not every league has the same rules, league house rules. \n\nBesides how an usa league allowed penalties (similiar to hockey), and how most usa stadium fields are shorter than the rest of the world, I don't know about any changes between countries and leagues around the world. Maybe you have more examples? I am curious, honestly.\n\n>There's different kinds of poker, Texas holdem, two draw etc., there's 15 iterations of poker, how do you think that happened? House and Casino rules spreading in popularity\n\nYes, and since now they are regarded as distinct games, they have distinct rules to obey. I understand how different games came to be, that resemble already existing games. Once a house rule becomes a different game, that other people can know without being taught by the original creators, then I am happy to play that game. But until just a single family plays like that, I cannot support that.\n\n>You're joking right? If you said the exact opposite then you'd be right. Do you think games and sports didn't exist until unified codes and rules became a thing in the last 100 years or so? Games have ran off house rules since before written word has existed. \n\nI know the history of games on the surface level. I know it was the norm until 100 years ago. And I know the history of laws on a surface level too. Regulating rules, games or laws, is a modern invention, thanks to globalization, electricity, and recently the internet. Making sure that the same rules apply to all people is a desirable goal. Unifying humanity means unifying all laws and responsibilites, not just rights. If there is a single set of rules, every people has to just learn a single set of rule, and understanding between people is better.\n\nMaking up rules when there already are rules makes it harder/worse for other people to join. My statement that it goes against the social aspect stands after globalization. But since I didn't specify this, I apologize. My bad.\n\n>Again your mad that you have to compromise, so you can be happy and make the other people less happy\n\nNo, no one should make compromises. But the other party made it worse for everybody by going against the already existing rules. If they haven't made up new house rules, no one would need a compromise. It is not me who make other people less happy, it is people who come up with house rules.\n\n>you don't want compromise so your compromise is you're always right and everyone else is at the disadvantage\n\nNo, this isn't my compromise. This isn't even a compromise. There shouldn't be a need for compromises, if the other party hadn't made up rules for themselves. They were the active party responsible for the inconvience, not me. And not everyone else is at a disadvantage. Most people can follow rules and don't make up new ones for themselves. I am just part of this majority.\n\nWhy would you accuse me of not being able to compromise? I never implied I am stubborn and don't play with others if they have house rules. I like playing games, I abide by the majority rule at the table, be it anything. It is just slightly inconvenient to play the game differently than I did before, and how the majority people play it. But for some reason you try to paint a negative picture about my opinion, about not liking the inconvenience caused by others. Why is that?",

When people modify rules, they're actually engaging in the same creative process that gave us these games in the first place.\n\nThink about it - some of the most popular games today started as modifications of other games. Basketball was invented by a PE teacher who needed an indoor winter sport. Magic: The Gathering spawned countless card game variants. Even Chess evolved from earlier games with different rules.\n\nThe real spirit of gaming isn't about rigid adherence to authority, but about bringing people together and creating shared experiences. When a group democratically agrees to modify rules, they're exercising collective creativity and agency - exactly the kind of bottom-up, community-driven innovation that drives progress in many areas of society.\n\nPlus, different groups have different needs. A family with young kids might need simplified rules. A group of experienced players might want added complexity. One-size-fits-all rules often reflect the biases and limitations of their creators.\n\nYour examples actually prove this point. UNO's stacking house rule is so widespread that Mattel eventually acknowledged it as an optional official rule. The various Monopoly modifications often make the game less ruthlessly capitalistic and more enjoyable. These organic community modifications improve games by making them more inclusive and adaptable.\n\nInstead of seeing rule modifications as violations of authority, try viewing them as democratic expressions of player autonomy and creativity. The best games evolve through community input, not top-down control.",

If you and your friends really enjoy playing something like Secret Hitler, but you have all gotten way too good at it and now the Fascist team always wins (especially with an odd number of players). Why not tweak the rules to make it a little bit harder to win (for the fascist team)?\n\nExample: you and all your friends discovered this game and all of the rules are great and it seems like a very fun game, but it says that whoever is tallest goes first. All of the other rules are great, but you feel that it isn\u2019t fair to the shorty of the friend group. So instead you choose who goes first based on something more reasonable. And in case you think this is a contrived example, Unstable Unicorns rules state that whoever is wearing the most colors goes first, as per the official rules.\n\nEdit: clarification of \u201cfor the fascist team\u201d",

UNO is a variant of *Crazy Eights*.  *Monopoly* took an anti-capitalist game called *The Landlord's Game* and changed it so that players could buy properties and charge rent to other players, rather than merely paying rent to the bank.  And *Cards Against Humanity* took another published card game, the now less well-known *Apples to Apples*, and made an adult version of it. \n\nAll three games themselves later had published variants with different rules.",

In *War of the Ring* (a fantastic game with a terrible rulebook), it is unclear whether moving into a region with a settlement but no enemy units is an \"attack\" or just a \"move\" (which has consequences on a whole bunch of different things).  The rules *do not say*.  In order to play, you must make a house rule one way or the other.  IIRC, this was fixed in the second edition.\n\nI've played dozens of other games where the rules could use a tweak.  Sometimes, this was because multiple expansions of the game don't play nicely together.  Other times it's just more fun when the rules are improved slightly.\n\nYou would likely run across the same issue (of non-standardization) with optional rules - *Cities and Knights of Catan* has an optional rule where players may choose not to contribute to the defense against the barbarian.\n\nAlso, anecdotally, every board game designer I know (and I know a bunch) would agree that it's totally fine to play with house rules as long as everyone is on board with them.  If not everybody agrees, most would say that it's better to use the standard rules.",

Jews were thought to be both at the center of vast globe spanning conspiracy yet at the same time weak and subhuman. There were hundreds of historical pogroms against Jews in Europe where government officials aided mobs in killing hundreds or thousands of Jews with crude improvised weapons.\n\nThere are simply no parallels with Muslims. Even the crudest xenophobes in Europe and the US are aware of divisions within the Muslim world, and the existence of pluralistic traditions like Indonesia. No one even pretends to believe that Muslims are at the center of vast conspiracies, yet those conspiratorial beliefs persist about Jews. Europeans historically rounded up and expelled Jews en masse on numerous occasions, yet recently have accepted millions of Muslim refugees. \n\nSweden jailed a man for burning a Koran and insulting Islam recently. In the 1940s the Vichy government in France helped round up Jews for extermination.",

Speaking for myself now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask that our close ally and client Israel, as the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, act a little more like it. You either feel this way or you don\u2019t.

There are plenty of Jew and Muslim interfaith couples, I have many many friends who are just that. Since they cannot do a religious marriage (no rabbi or imma will preside) the state doesn't recognize their marriage unless performed elsewhere, usually Cyprus.\n\n\nThe whole kicking west bank Palestinians out is because the land was legally bought and paid for, and recognized as such under the supreme court. You people never bring up the many, many, many times that actual illegal settlements in the west bank were forcefully torn down and dismantled.\n\n\nTo your last point (potentially the most idiotic one), you just gladly and happily give a pass to every other middle Eastern (and non-ME) country. \"Oh, they don't call themselves a democracy, so what they do is fine and I won't protest them\". \"Oh, the other countries have a close relationship with the US, so they can do whatever they want.\"\n\n\nIdiotic, no?

Some grist for your mill:\n\nFinancial times - https://www.ft.com/content/3a882ba0-f53d-4c94-8a45-4cb2f37b7adc\n\nDissent mag (left) - https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/how-israels-illiberal-democracy-became-a-model-for-the-right/\n\nTel Aviv review of books - https://www.tarb.co.il/israels-very-own-illiberal-democracy-2/\n\nTablet mag (conservative Jewish cultural mag - are *they* antisemitic?) - https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/illiberal-democracy-middle-east\n\nJerusalem post (opinion; is he antisemitic too?) https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-749795\n\nAgain you can agree with this or not, that\u2019s fine. But you asked, so here you are.",

It would be a lot easier to give a definitive answer if the waters hadn't muddied by you lot acting in bad faith and pretending you aren't seething inside at the existence of Jews doing well for themselves for once.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd you also roped in the cliche of holding Israel to another standard! Well done. If you read a single one of the sources, you would see that they all describe a problem that nearly every single country on the planet has. What do you do with those on the extreme left or right wing? Nothing described or discussed in a single article of yours disproves that Israel is a liberal democracy. And they're all opinion pieces anyway, so of little value.\u00a0\n\n\nDissent mag is a ridiculous inclusion as well, but I bet it felt good to you to add in, didn't it?\n\n\nAnyway, I'm truly done this time. You go on seething while Israel successfully protects its interests, its citizens (of ALL nationalities, religions, and races) and its future.\u00a0",

You just take it for granted that somehow you/west is \"better\". That's exactly what this post is about. If you actually look at history, and even modern history (last 100 years) it's actually the West that needs to have the conversation with itself.\n\nYour words would have \\*a bit\\* more weight if America, backed by Western powers, wasn't funding the genocide of the Palestinians right as we speak.

You are proving my point, and the point of this post. Western world, is starting to look at Muslims like a monolith to hate.\n\nHere is Yasir Qadhi condemning the attacks:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEW7PL8fA-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEW7PL8fA-Q)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasir\\_Qadhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasir_Qadhi)\n\n\\> Qadhi has written books and lectured widely on Islam and contemporary Muslim issues, and is considered one of the most influential Muslim scholars in the United States.[^(\\[12\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasir_Qadhi#cite_note-:3-12) He has also consistently been listed in the annual listicle [The 500 Most Influential Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_500_Most_Influential_Muslims).[^(\\[13\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasir_Qadhi#cite_note-13)\n\nDoes this pass your silly convoluted test?\n\n  \nedit:\n\nMuch like laws of physics, viewing any large group of humans as a monolith is \\*wrong\\* and bigoted. No matter your justification.",

You say treat all equally yet you REFUSE to even acknowledge that Islamist extremism is bad. Will you not face your own bias? Will you not look within yourself and question if you are being arrogant and therefor have a wall up the blocs you from learning anything that goes against your preconceived notion? \n\n Where is the humanist in that?

The only media outlet that\u2019s calling it a genocide is Al jazeera. Which is based in qatar which funds Hamas directly. Al jazeera, the same news outlet that reported that an Israeli rocket blew up a hospital killing 5k people. Which they caught on their live feed. Which actually turned out to be a rocket fired by Hamas that fell short of its target because Hamas\u2019 rockets tend to be sewer pipes they ripped out of the ground that was given to them from international aid. Turns out it hit the parking lot and nobody was killed. Hamas literally murdered children in cold blood on October 7th. You can easily find pictures from that day online and on Reddit. It\u2019s a lot different killing civilians with bombs than it is to look them in the eyes and shoot them, which hamas did. This conflict isn\u2019t about \u201c colonialism \u201c that\u2019s just a convenient buzzword co-opted by Iranian propaganda knowing it would resonate with western youth. Hamas wants to rid Jews from their ANCESTRAL HOMELAND. They want Islamic supremacy in the Middle East. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about to them. Even with the war going on Israel has a better human rights track record than a majority of the Middle East. With How many Muslim and Christian countries in the world. There just can\u2019t be one Jewish country. Not to the people that side with hamas, Iran and their allies. People love dead Jews. I\u2019ll bet anybody my entire life savings that the Palestinian population will recover easily within the next decade while the Jewish population is still recovering from the holocaust 80 years later. Man, if only those people would actually take into account what the Jewish people have gone through for thousands of years. Long live Israel \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1",

Seriously now, you can be a Muslim and go \"Yeah actually bad things have been done in the name of our religion\", but to outright say nothing has been done you're either incredibly stupid or incredibly supporting of it.\n\nAND before anyone starts the Islamophobia angle, if White guys constantly went to middle eastern countries and bombed the place, they'd be *rightly* hated, and it would be  totally understandable.

Islam is judged by this weird double standard where people basically say that anybody not committing terrorism or actively supporting it is \"moderate.\"     \n        \nObviously the terrorism is horrible, as is the heckler's veto from implied terrorism.  South Park has gone after almost every group under the sun, and yet the only episodes you can't stream are the ones focusing on how people cave to threats of violence by doing things like censoring images of mohamed.  The fact that now those entire episodes are unavailable is either ironic, or perfectly fitting... I'm not sure which.       \n          \nBut beyond the terrorism and threats of violence and such, islam is incredibly regressive, and is horrible in regards to things like gay rights and women's rights.  Even without terrorism and violence, there is still a great deal to criticize.",

        "text": "Every Muslim person I've known, who has grown up in the Western world, have been moderate good people. I have many good friends who are Muslims, and from the people I've met, no more seem to have extremist views, than any other religion. I have lots of respect for my many Muslim friends. They care for their communities, and care about their integrity and morality. \n\nAll that being said, this is my experience in Western countries. I've come across numerous polls from other Muslim majority countries with shocking results. Questions like \"do you think death is the appropriate punishment for leaving the Muslim faith?\" usually get a strong majority from samples of the entire Muslim world. Egypt is not some backwards third world country, and 86% of people there support the death penalty for changing religions. Add to that questions about women's rights and free speech, and it's a disturbing picture about a HUGE percentage of all muslims in the world. Britain had a poll that showed over 70% of Muslims supported arresting the Danish cartoonist who portrayed Allah. \n\nSorry, but you don't get to pretend to be a part of the modern world if you believe that, and that's not just a few bad apples. I certainly don't condemn any religion in total, and I have nothing but respect for people who are moderates and Muslims, but I'll definitely say that I think all people of any faith, who are against free speech, against equal rights for women, and support the death penalty for apostasy, are backwards savages with no place in the modern world. If any country is made up of a large majority of people who believe those things, I think it's fair to think of that country as being not compatible with modern society.",

It\u2019s attacking inherently evil values that happen to be spread by a significant portion of Islam, particularly in Islamic nations.\n\nVery little of this has a parallel in Judaism.

You haven't presented any cogent/coherent reasoning about anything and yet somehow have started mildly insulting me and my ability to reason.\n\nJews have experienced a crap ton of hatred for a large part of history, going back thousands of years. Why is it wrong to say that another group is now is starting to be dehumanized much the same ways the Jews were dehumanized prior to holocaust?\n\nThis doesn't detract anything from the Jews, which you seem to be thinking. Unless you are a Jewish supremacist and believe that Jews somehow have a monopoly on being the most oppressed or something for political gains.",

        "text": "Alright here is the issue. There is an issue with religious fundamentalism being far too common and possibly even the norm in many if not most Muslim communities world wide.\n\nThere is an exceptional amount of evidence for this now. I will share a small bit to make my case. \n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/\n\nBack in 2013 pew research center collected a lot of data on attitudes if Muslims around the globe and the results are illustrating religious conservatism and fundamentalism being absolutely normal\n\nFor example support for sharia in the Middle East and North Africa averages around 70%\n\nIn Iraq it\u2019s 90%\n\nThat level of support for an obvious medieval law system should be extremely concerning to everybody.\n\n- Since 1970 according to https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/ (a Maryland university managed database) there has been about 200,000 terrorist attacks globally \n\nAccording to GTD and also to https://www.cat-int.org/?lang=en (a French organisation focused on tracking global terrorism trends) about 50,000 of that total 200,000 have been enacted by Islamic extremists. \n\nThat is 1/4 of all the terrorism in the world since 1970 that has been enacted by a single religious demographic. \n\nFor context the rest of the 150,000 was carried out by a myriad of different groups for a myriad if different reasons. I included a list if some of the groups tracked by GTD below.\n\n\n\n\t\u2022\tIrish Republican Army (IRA)\n\t\u2022\tBasque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA)\n\t\u2022\tRed Army Faction (RAF)\n\t\u2022\tWeather Underground\n\t\u2022\tTamil Tigers (LTTE)\n\t\u2022\tJewish Underground\n\t\u2022\tKahane Chai\n\t\u2022\tKu Klux Klan (KKK)\n\t\u2022\tNational Socialist Underground (NSU)\n\t\u2022\tEarth Liberation Front (ELF)\n\t\u2022\tAnimal Liberation Front (ALF)\n\t\u2022\tRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)\n\t\u2022\tShining Path (Sendero Luminoso)\n\t\u2022\tKurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK)\n\t\u2022\tSikh Extremists (e.g., Babbar Khalsa)\n\t\u2022\tCombat 18\n\t\u2022\tAryan Nations\n\t\u2022\tNational Liberation Army (ELN)\n\t\u2022\tBlack September Organization\n\t\u2022\tSandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN)\n\t\u2022\tZapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN)\n\t\u2022\tWeather Underground Organization\n\t\u2022\tRevolutionary People\u2019s Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C)\n\t\u2022\tThe Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA)\n\t\u2022\tRevolutionary Organization 17 November\n\t\u2022\tLord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA)\n\t\u2022\tArmy of God (anti-abortion extremist group)\n\t\u2022\tAtomwaffen Division\n\t\u2022\tPhineas Priesthood\n\t\u2022\tNew People\u2019s Army (NPA)\n\t\u2022\tGreek Revolutionary Organization 17 November\n\n\nSo very very obviously Islam has been incredibly over represented in global terrorism for at least the last 50 years.\n\nSo Muslims are \n\n1. Massively overrepresented in contributing to word violence \n\n2. Show in general an intensely concerning amount of support for ideas that are contradictory to modern ethics. \n\nNow I am just going to stop there because I believe this should be compelling enough to convince you that widespread concern about Islam  is entirely understandable and justified. \n\nI am not however denying that there is a small amount if actual Islamophobia occurring but I truly believe you will find that it is massively over exaggerated and that in fact very reasonable criticism of Islam and the culture around it are more often than not being labelled as Islamophobia.",

Pastor Mukisa, 30, had received threats since the conversions in September.\u00a0\n\nTusubira reported seeing flames from the house and, upon reaching the site, found it destroyed with plastic petrol bottles nearby. Police are pursuing the attackers, who are from a nearby village and were known to the pastor. The brutal incident has left the community in shock, with Tusubira calling for prayers and justice.\u00a0\n\n**Husband Attacks Wife with Acid for Converting to Christianity**\u00a0\n\nIn a separate incident in Nankoma, Bugiri District, Hidaaya Nabafa, a 27-year-old mother of three, was severely beaten and doused with acid by her husband after she admitted her new Christian faith.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNabafa, who converted in August, had attended a worship service on Oct.9, which angered her husband, Juma Nsibambi. He assaulted her and poured battery acid on her, causing severe burns that will require ongoing treatment and reconstructive surgery.\u00a0\n\nThese attacks underscore the increasing persecution of Christians in Uganda. Although Uganda\u2019s constitution guarantees religious freedom, reports of violence against converts are mounting. Muslims comprise no more than 12% of Uganda\u2019s population, with most concentrated in the East.\u00a0",

                                "text": "I am completely aware, in fact you will absolutely see more from Christians especially Catholicsim in the near future. I openly acknowledge that because I understand their extrabiblical prophecies. I also understand Islamic prophecies. But to say Muslims are the \"new Jews\" and by that I am assuming you mean persecution wise - correct? \n\nHave you noticed that these examples I have given you, a few scattered throughout your post are from the last month.  Not drudged up from history, and again - I say this with the full admission that there will be more Christians persecuting Jews and Muslims in the future. \n\nYou say you are a humanist correct? I have provided a quote from a Muslim Scholar, you did not respond to it and maybe it got lost in the multitude so I will post it again, this is from 2014 which shows a pattern of Palestinian behavior on how they sacrifice their children and blame the Jews, this is FROM a Muslim Scholar, him calling out the truth of the matter is not Islamaphobic in any sense of the word. It is speaking truth.\n\n**Sheikh Ahmad Adwan, who introduces himself as a Muslim scholar who lives in Jordan, said on his personal Facebook page that there is no such thing as \u201cPalestine\u201d in the Koran. Allah has assigned the Holy Land to the Children of Israel until the Day of Judgment (Koran, Sura 5 \u2013 \u201cThe Sura of the Table\u201d, Verse 21), and \u201cWe made the Children of Israel the inheritors (of the land)\u201d (Koran, Sura 26 \u2013 \u201cThe Sura of the Poets\u201d, Verse 59).**\n\n\u201cI say to those who distort their Lord\u2019s book, the Koran: From where did you bring the name Palestine, you liars, you accursed, when Allah has already named it \u201cThe Holy Land\u201d and bequeathed it to the Children of Israel until the Day of Judgment. There is no such thing as \u2018Palestine\u2019 in the Koran. Your demand for the Land of Israel is a falsehood and it constitutes an attack on the Koran, on the Jews and their land. Therefore you won\u2019t succeed, and Allah will fail you and humiliate you, because Allah is the one who will protect them (i.e. the Jews).\u201d\n\nThe sheikh added: \u201cThe Palestinians are the killers of children, the elderly and women. They attack the Jews and then they use those (children, the elderly and women) as human shields and hide behind them, without mercy for their children as if they weren\u2019t their own children, in order to tell the public opinion that the Jews intended to kill them. This is exactly what I saw with my own two eyes in the 70\u2019s, when they attacked the Jordanian army, which sheltered and protected them. Instead of thanking it (the Jordanian army), they brought their children forward to (face) the Jordanian army, in order to make the world believe that the army kills their children. This is their habit and custom, their viciousness, their having hearts of stones towards their children, and their lying to public opinion, in order to get its support.\u201d\n\nIt is worth mentioning, that the above mentioned sheikh visited Israel and met Jewish religious scholars. The \u201cIsrael in Arabic\u201d site conducted an interview with him, in which he said that the reason for his openness towards the Jewish people \u201ccomes from my acknowledgment of their sovereignty on their land and my belief in the Koran, which told us and emphasized this in many places, like His (Allah\u2019s) saying \u201dOh People (i.e the Children of Israel), enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned unto you\u201d (Koran, Sura 5 \u2013 \u201cThe Sura of the Table\u201d, Verse 21), and His saying \u201cWe made the Children of Israel the inheritors (of the land)\u201d (Koran, Sura 26 \u2013 \u201cThe Sura of the Poets\u201d, Verse 59) and many other verses.\n\nHe (Adwan) added: \u201c(The Jews) are peaceful people who love peace, who are not hostile and are not aggressors, but if they are attacked, they defend themselves while causing as little damage to the attackers as possible. It is an honor for them that Allah has chosen them over the worlds \u2013 meaning over the people and the Jinns until the Day of Judgment. I made the reasons for Allah\u2019s choice clear in my books and pamphlets. When Allah chose them, He didn\u2019t do so out of politeness, and He wasn\u2019t unjust other peoples, it is just that they (the Jews) deserved this.\u201d (Cohen E.

Nor of Muslims. \n\nSeeing as you know very little about Islam and Muslims I will teach you - and I hope you are humble enough to learn. I respect Muslims and their devotion and I am perfectly willing to call out other  warring religions as I have already done in response to your post. I also hope you are humble enough to see that this is a Holy War and to really understand it, you have to understand all sides prophecy and why they think the way they do. Just because someone points it out does not make it Islamaphobia. \n\nSince its inception the IRGC has also been the main organ for advancing the clergy\u2019s objective of exporting the Islamic Revolution abroad. This is confirmed by Iran\u2019s 1979 constitution, which establishes the IRGC as an \u201cideological army\u201d and mandates it with \u201can ideological mission of jihad in God\u2019s way; that is extending sovereignty of God\u2019s law throughout the world.\u201d Unlike the regular Iranian army (the\u00a0*Artesh*), whose primary objective is to protect Iran\u2019s borders, the IRGC\u2019s principal mission is to protect the Shi\u2019a clergy and advance the Islamic Revolution at home and abroad.\n\nThe Quran claims that Muslims worship the same God as the Jews (e.g. Sura 29:26). Muhammad asserts the Quran is a confirmation of the scriptures that God gave to the children of Israel, not that the scriptures in the Bible are not valid (the italicized footnote comment is from Quran.com): We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them. And to Allah we all submit. (Sura 2:136) Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures.1 (Sura 2:41) Footnote - 1 This refers to the passages in the Torah and the Gospel So, Muhammad taught that people should believe the Bible and that his teachings confirmed it, not that they overrode it.\n\nMuslims believe that following the teachings of the prophets, regardless of their specific faith tradition, is essential for salvation. Sincere Jews, Christians, and followers of other Abrahamic faiths who adhere to the teachings of their respective prophets (e.g. Moses for the Jews and Jesus for the Christians) may find salvation according to Islamic beliefs (cf. also Sura 2:177). Islam, however, sees few people in such groups as sincere.\n\n\u02f9Remember\u02fa when Allah said, \u201cO Jesus! I will take you and raise you up to Myself. I will deliver you from those who disbelieve, and elevate your followers 15 above the disbelievers until the Day of Judgment. (Sura 3:55)\n\nNow, when it comes to prophetic events, most Muslims seem to be looking for a leader who will arise in these end times, who is sometimes called the Imam Mahdi: In a 2012 Pew poll, in most of the countries surveyed in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, half or more Muslims believe that they will personally witness the appearance of the Mahdi. In Islamic eschatology, the messianic figure known as the Mahdi (the Guided One) will appear before **the Day of Judgment**. This expectation is most common in Afghanistan (83 percent), followed by Iraq (72), Tunisia (67), and Malaysia (62).41 Mahdi means the \u201cGuided One.\u201d The Imam Mahdi is believed to be a leader who will unite Muslims and eliminate Islamic poverty.\n\nThe day of judgment will only arise , when Ar-Rum are the dominant civilization of the world. (Hadith from Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj al-Naysaburi209) \u201cAr-Rum\u201d literally means Roman. But in the above context, this means the European western civilization will be the dominate civilization in the end.  Basically, a European world order will replace the Anglo-American dominated one of the past couple of centuries.\n\nAlthough the belief in a \u201cMahdi\u201d apparently had been a minority Sunni view and has had rejection by some Sunni authorities, \u201cthe Muslim World League issued a fatwa in October of 1976 commanding Sunni Muslims to believe in the concept of an Islamic Savior called the Mahdi.\u201d222 It should also be noted that some Sunni groups want a Caliph to arise and rule an Islamic caliphate that includes all the territory from northwest Africa through the Middle East and even further east.223 However, Sunnis (who vastly outnumber the Shi\u2019ite Muslims) should not change their anti-Mahdi views (various Sunni scholars also agree224) or want such a Caliph, because of what the Bible shows will happen. Shi\u2019ites also would do well to recognize that just because someone may claim to be the final 104 Imam (or Mahdi), does not mean that God will agree that he should be followed. Neither Sunnis nor Shi\u2019ites should support one who will appear to possibly be the final Imam/Caliph in the next decade or so. A major leader of Islamic lands will apparently make such claims and rise up, but will be defeated soundly.\n\nSo to go back to my point on Iran, mainly Shia Muslims, funding the Houthis, Hezzbolah and the Palestinians, it is about their prophesied Imam Madhi and the Day of Judgement.",

On the contrary, such actions would invite legal repercussions for those engaging in hate-speech against any group, including people of Islamic faith.",

But Jewish identity doesn\u2019t conform to Western categories, despite centuries of attempts by society to shoehorn it in. This makes sense, because Judaism predates Western categories. It\u2019s not quite a religion, because one can be Jewish regardless of observance or specific belief. (Einstein, for example, was proudly Jewish but not religiously observant.) But it\u2019s also not quite a race, because people can convert in! It\u2019s not merely a culture or an ethnicity, because that leaves out all the religious components. And it\u2019s not simply a nationality, because although Jews do have a homeland and many identify as part of a nation, others do not.",

We take on positions of power, within politics, finance, media, and so on, and use that power to promote various forms of degeneracy, funneling in immigrants, poisoning the economy, promoting queer relationships, things like that. This is a form of bigotry that I don't think Muslims are typically the targets of, and it is, notably, a form of bigotry that persists against Jews. Digging into the deepest layers of any arbitrary conspiracy theory will typically find Jews as the vile masterminds. Muslims just get their own flavors of bigotry, flavors that, notably, don't get applied that much to Jews. Muslims don't get accused of orchestrating a White genocide by promoting open borders, and Jews don't get accused of having a fundamentally violent religion that inevitably causes its followers to turn to terrorism.",

I believe that focusing on one of these three religions more is okay as of right now, as it is causing the biggest issues, especially in Europe and majority-Islam countries. And especially with the special treatment Islam gets, it\u2019s refreshing to see people with opposite opinions and criticism of it. Disliking islam also has nothing to do with race, it is a religion, not an ethnicity, it is a choice to be muslim, and if you dislike that choice, that\u2019s okay. Unlike Judaism and Christianity, Islam is **currently** being the extremely oppressive religion in many countries. We must stop that.",

No country would have religious laws (except freedom to worship whichever you want or none at all) and _no religious exceptions, for anything_. Religion is something private between you, your deity/-ies and your religious community (if such exists). Nobody else should ever be affected or forced to adapt to _your_ religion, because that is unreasonable.\nThat means I'm not fond of most followers of Islam as most of them seems to be in favour of sharia laws (to different extents, of course, but still).\nIslam is also the religion of the three big ones that has basically not reformed itself at all to adapt to modern times and values, which also makes it very much easier to understand that the \"clash\" between it and modern society becomes much bigger than with the other two. I'm pretty sure this is a key reason why more people are okay with disliking its followers, even though they maybe can't put it into words.",

The judicial system perpetuates this system of repression, and the monarchy carefully manages it to ensure that religious dissent is swiftly and rigorously punished.\n\nSystematic purges of judges and their replacement by more radical justices could be \u201cimpacting ongoing legal cases against religious minorities and dissenters,\u201d according to a 2023 USCIRF report. \u201cBeginning in the summer of 2022, Saudi courts began issuing egregiously long prison sentences against dissidents \u2014 including religious dissidents \u2014 who peacefully expressed their beliefs.\u201d\n\nHuman rights groups and survivors of the Saudi penal system report regular torture and the acceptance of forced confessions in court in a practice that contradicts international human rights standards on the treatment of prisoners and the\u00a0acceptable use of evidence. In 2022, a group of 81 men were executed in what the U.S. Department of State called \u201cthe largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdom\u2019s history.\u201d Among those executed were dozens of religious minority Shia Muslims.\n\nSpeaking in a TV interview, the head of the\u00a0Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice dismissed the mass execution as the \u201celiminat\\[ion of\\] violators,\u201d calling it \u201cone of the most legitimate actions \u2026 to preserve religion.\u201d\n\nInternational law requires that the death penalty be reserved for only the most serious crimes. However, with its lack of a written penal code and the wide sentencing discretion given to judges, Saudi Arabia is notorious for handing down the death penalty in cases where such a punishment is patently undeserved.\n\nIn response to Saudi Arabia\u2019s consistently egregious record on religious freedom, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has recommended adding it to the Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) list every year since 2001, when it began making the recommendations.",

In an apartheid that cannot happen.\n\nYou are dehumanizing a group, and my giving facts about what is happening are not silly gymnastics. I have provided many facts you have yet to respond to, and the only answer you are happy with is Israel is the bad guy.  AGAIN I said many Muslims are good and kind people, that is not dehumanizing them in the least, pointing out Islamic extremism is not dehumanizing Muslims. \n\nI showed you facts of very recent persecutions from extremists, yet you try and justify it by saying back in the day there was a KKK and back in 94 an Israelite extremist killed 24 Palestinians. \n\nIf you are a humanist, take a moment to humanize the Jews.\n\nAgain if you ignore the fact the Palestinians have literally thrown their children in the line of fire to specifically blame the Jews as is their custom - spoken from a Muslim Scholar in Jordan, you choose to ignore facts, doing your own silly little mental gymnastics to avoid humanizing the Jews.\n\nPeople who say Israel is apartheid do not actually understand what Israel is. Westbank with PA - who literally pays martyrs for Jews they kill and has for many many years has a NEED to be separate, specifically for that reason. \n\nCheck out this video, a store called Hitler 2 in Gaza, they glorify Hitler, and you call Israel nazi's?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1Rua3DCd-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1Rua3DCd-o)",

But I would agree with the overall sentiment that for the last at least 50 years Muslims (typically Arabs) have been dehumanized by politicians, the media, entertainment, and militaries. 9/11 poured gasoline on the fire, to the point where I hear people say absolutely horrifying things about Muslims and Arab people like it\u2019s nothing. If they changed Muslim to black or Jewish they would instantly see how incredibly racist they were being but somehow don\u2019t see it with Muslims. They view them as another species, which is how you can have the western world happily supporting genocide in Palestine.\u00a0\n\nSo again I agree with your basic point. But it\u2019s not that Muslims have become the Jews. What\u2019s happening is happening all over the world.

        "text": ">If more women left men after infidelity, it would send the message that infidelity is not acceptable.\n\n\nIt is strongly supposed that the reason humans are like humans and not like chimps is that back in the days society followed a tournament relationship system, with a big strong male at the head of a harem, some weaker males basically were offering gifts and taking care of females, who would then sneak out and cheat on the big dominant male to have the kids of the males helping them.\n\n\nWhich explains why we are almost unique in being a monogamous (people form couples, not harems) egalitarian (everyone has a shot at forming a couple) species and why we see sex as something that has to be done in private.\n\n\nYou could say cheating is what made us what we are. Fighting that is going to be a complex thing.\n\n\n>If more women left men after experiencing the first signs of abuse, it would send a message that abuse is not acceptable.\n\n\nThat is really not understanding well how abuse work. It borders on the \"to solve homelessness, just have homeless people buy a home\" level of advice.\n\n\n>If more women avoided relationships with men who promote obvious disparities in housework, childcare, etc, it would send a message that inequality is not acceptable.\n\n\nIn fact, studies that have actually bothered to look at things like time worked, spent commuting, and working on chores inside *and outside* the house have shown that the repartition was generally equal or at the disadvantage of men.\n\n\nSo you could say that is pretty much achieved.\n\n\nBut then there is the question of perception of things. People who frame that as an issue often decide to only care about a very limited set of things that is generally done more by women, while neglecting all of the rest, and framing that disparity as an issue.\n\n\n>If women as a whole would stop allowing and enabling and putting up with the bad behaviors of men, the bad behaviors would become less of an accepted norm and the quality of men would improve overall.\n\n\nI would also point out that this is not operating in a vacuum. Women are not perfect flawless beings. And people respond differently to different people. This is all a feedback loop. It can go as a virtuous or a vicious cycle.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, a common thing in couples is for people to have differing standards on how to do things. And for the person with the highest standard to complain when the person with the lowest standard doesn't perform up to level. That's punishing someone for doing good, or making an effort. Do that a few times, and you have trained the person into actually not doing the thing or making an effort. Good job.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you want to help the person raise their standard, you have to reward them for trying, even when they fail to do as good a job as you'd wish, and resist the urge to complain. You have to explain in detail what you want and encourage that. And teach your partner how to do the same when you fall short.",

        "text": "I don\u2019t know if this is right. Some men suck. Some women suck. They often suck in different ways and to varying degrees of societal harm. \n\nOn infidelity, both men and women suck. According to the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 57% of men and 54% of women admit to committing infidelity at some point in their lives\n\nMen and women are perpetrators of abuse. One in four women report having experienced domestic abuse, while one in seven men report having experienced domestic abuse. Clearly, women report having experienced domestic abuse more often. But men don\u2019t recognise abuse or report it as often. \n\nNow, domestic abuse at the hands of men can be much more dangerous. We\u2019re not doing enough to tackle that at all, but let\u2019s be clear women don\u2019t let this happen to them one study of domestic abuse homicides found that of 888 cases, 43% had separated or taken steps to separate from their partner.\n\nBut ultimately it\u2019s not on any one group to fix this. I\u2019d also just reflect on how wise it is to tell women (one in four of whom will have experienced abuse) that it\u2019s their fault. \n\nWe all play a role in fixing these problems. There are many ways men can contribute to or allay these issues. Many ways women can too. But it\u2019s not as simple as saying, men do these things because women put up with it.\n\nThink about incels for a second. They\u2019re men that, by definition, no woman is putting up with. But we see them spread hate online, we see them shoot people dead in schools and in the streets. Isolating men isn\u2019t the solution. It creates a different, potentially worse problem.",

Based on that, we can see that men acting up wasn\u2019t because women let them; it was because when left to their own free will, they will do what they want and a lot of them will mistreat women. Only once women started having rights and choices could we then blame women for putting up with men that behave this way, and act like men wouldn\u2019t have behaved that way otherwise.\n\nDo you think that women who work outside the home/to generate income do so because they want to or because men let them?",

We can recognise why someone could by turned to crime (bad upbringing, etc) and it may impact sentencing, but if they are of sound mind and not insane we still hold them as ultimately accountable for their actions and it's them who gets punished - not their parents or bullies from school, etc.\n\nThe same applies here.

I work in mental health and I see a lot of women who theoretically know what they should do, and will almost come to me embarassed that they didnt end it after the first sign of abuse.\n\nBut the reason is because I am a support system. They feel safe and supported with me to even open up about what that first sign was. And I encourage them because its normal to struggle, particularly to struggle to even recognise something as abuse.\n\nI dont just mean support systems in a formal mental health support kind if way. Families, friends, community mentalities often reinforce the enablement of abuse and infidelity etc. And it seems to me a LOT of women are unable to end things early because their loved ones dismiss, or defend the man, or imply support would be taken away if the woman ended the remarionship, or worse that serious harm would come to them. At least support like housing. \n\nI think we need to be better to women who find themselves stuck socially and not patronise them by saying \"this is abuse, leave\" over and over. They know. They don't believe they can. We need to help them believe that.",

    "text": "Heightism is one of the last socially acceptable forms of discrimination, and its impact on individuals is profound, yet grossly overlooked. Society\u2019s bias toward taller individuals creates structural advantages for them in nearly every aspect of life\u2014from career opportunities to romantic desirability. The data is irrefutable:\n\n1. **Economic Inequities:**\n   - People 6'0\" and taller earn about 10% more annually than people 5'8\" or shorter, even when controlling for education and experience.  \n   - Leadership roles are disproportionately occupied by taller individuals. The average height of Fortune 500 CEOs is 6', while the average American male stands at just 5'9\".  \n   - Historical biases are equally glaring: the average height of U.S. presidents is 5'11\", significantly taller than the historical male average of 5'8\".\n\n2. **Romantic and Social Disadvantages:**\n   - On dating apps, men 6'0\" and taller receive roughly 40% more matches than men of average height (5'9\").  \n   - Each additional inch above 5'9\" correlates with a 2\u20134% increase in match rates, while men under 5'8\" experience 40\u201350% fewer matches.  \n   - Nearly half of women list a height preference in their dating profiles, with 6'0\" being the most commonly cited minimum. Yet only 14.5% of men in the U.S. meet this criterion.\n\nThese disparities are not simply numbers; they reflect a society that privileges physical traits over merit, personality, or effort. The psychological toll is immense. Many shorter individuals suffer from low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety stemming from societal rejection\u2014a phenomenon I call *height disphoria*. \n\nTo combat this deeply ingrained heightism, it\u2019s time for society to embrace the concept of *preferred stature*. Much like gender identity, stature is not merely a biological fact but also a deeply personal and social construct. A person's \"height\" is their physical measurement, while their \"stature\" is how they perceive and identify themselves in relation to societal expectations.\n\nConsider this: A 5'5\" man who identifies as 6'1\" experiences life through the lens of his preferred stature. This self-perception should be acknowledged and respected by society. To create an equitable environment, I propose the following steps:\n\n1. **Preferred Stature Recognition:**\n   - Individuals should be allowed to declare their preferred stature publicly, much like pronouns. For example, a person could include their preferred stature after their name: \"Michael Jones, 6'2\".\"  \n   - Official documents, workplace interactions, and academic settings could adopt this practice to ensure inclusivity.\n\n2. **Addressing Misheighting:**\n   - Misheighting (failing to recognize someone\u2019s preferred stature) can be deeply invalidating. Institutions should provide clear guidelines on how to apologize and correct such situations, promoting respect and understanding.\n\n4. **Cultural Shifts in Dating and Social Norms:**\n   - Dating platforms should ban discriminatory practices that reinforce heightism, such as explicit height requirements in profiles.  \n   - Social campaigns should challenge stereotypes about short men, empowering them to be seen as equals in both romantic and professional contexts.\n\n### Challenging the Double Standard\n\nWhy does society embrace gender fluidity and support individuals\u2019 right to self-identify, yet dismisses height disphoria as trivial or absurd? Is it because heightism disproportionately affects men, a group less culturally empowered to express vulnerability?  \n\n### The Moral Imperative\n\nBy respecting preferred stature, we not only combat heightism but also foster a society that values individuality and personal identity over arbitrary physical traits. The question is not whether height disphoria deserves recognition\u2014it does\u2014but why we\u2019ve ignored it for so long.\n\nWould you support a world where everyone, regardless of their height or stature, has equal opportunities and societal respect? If not, ask yourself: Why should a 5'5\" man who identifies as 6'1\" continue to be treated as inferior when we could create a world where his stature is respected?  \n\nIt\u2019s time to end heightism and embrace a more inclusive society. Preferred stature could be the first step in this journey. Let\u2019s have the courage to rethink our biases and create a world where everyone stands tall\u2014regardless of their physical height.\n",

And that\u2019s all that matters - it\u2019s not like Bon Dylan or Pete Seeger have the most beautiful or in-tune voices. \n\n- Vapid and pretentious: if anything their music seems really straightforward and lacking in pretention.

Compare that to lyrics by Elton John in the 70s or even some lyrics from Surfs Up or Sgt Peppers - these are much more \u201chigh concept.\u201d",

I will say that you do seem to have a strange view on what makes music \u201cgood\u201d. Imperfect vocals and tunings are seen as character. Especially much of modern indie alternative music today contains intentionally slightly mistuned guitars, intentionally sloppy playing. Some of it unintentional, but it doesn\u2019t matter because it aligns with the intended sound, aesthetic and vibe. Some of my favorite bands have singers who aren\u2019t technically good at singing, as in hitting the notes accurately. \n\nIt seems that you\u2019re unaware of a wide range of genres and what a lot of music is, by your choosing this band and your description. You seem to have a view of music needing to sound more \u201cperfect\u201d or at least not sound noticeably imperfect. This is your personal taste. It saddens me because in my opinion you have strayed away from what music itself is supposed to be about. \n\nAgain this is all about personal taste. No one is going to convince you to change your ears because it\u2019s impossible. But this is more about you not being able to appreciate a wide range of beloved bands and musical genres, not just this band, who are incredible in my opinion. I say this because of your description of reasons why they are bad in your eyes \n\nSomeone could be grunting while hitting a tree stump with a boot, and it could be good. Even revolutionary. The problem here in my eyes is a misunderstanding or lack of appreciation for what music is in the fist place",

If not then we can go from there, but if you accept that that can have musical value, merit, and be seen as good art, then we have an issue with your position because that directly contradicts and conflicts with your position. \n\nMusic is art.

    "text": "Listen (or better, read) I make no pretense to hide it, I'm a Jew, I'm a Zionist and Israel is important to me for very deep and personal reasons. This is not what I'm talking about in this post or the view that I challenge you to challenge. This is also not about the war in Gaza, and although I believe that the war in Gaza and the revolution in Syria are part of one and the same conflict, this post is not about that.\n\nThis post is about a point of criticism, anger, whatever you want to call it that has been levied towards Israel for taking over the buffer zone on the other side of the contested Golan heights, in that part of the Levant which has come to be known as Syria. I want to have an information based conversation so here are some points and references.  \n\n\n* **Premise:** Syria and Israel are separated by the Golan Heights, a contested territory under Israeli control, and a demilitarized buffer zone monitored by the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). **Source:** [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/israel-syria-attack-buffer-zone-golan-assad-6ee75aca7f5d820dd623b2aba4a62407?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Rebel Attack on UNDOF Forces:** On **December 7, 2024**, rebel forces attacked UNDOF positions, forcing peacekeepers to retreat to Israeli-held areas for safety. **Source:** [The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-army-says-it-is-assisting-un-force-in-repelling-attack-in-syria?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Israeli Occupation of the Buffer Zone:** On **December 8, 2024**, Israel occupied the buffer zone, citing security concerns following the collapse of the Assad regime and the retreat of Syrian forces. **Source:** [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/israel-syria-attack-buffer-zone-golan-assad-6ee75aca7f5d820dd623b2aba4a62407?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Security Concerns**\n\nThe border between Syria and Israel had experienced relative peace for nearly 50 years, maintained by the 1974 disengagement agreement and UNDOF's presence. **Source:** [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/israel-syria-attack-buffer-zone-golan-assad-6ee75aca7f5d820dd623b2aba4a62407?utm_source=chatgpt.com). However, the recent instability in Syria, including the rise of rebel groups with uncertain intentions toward Israel, has heightened security concerns. Notably, the leading rebel faction, *Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)*, has roots in al-Qaeda, raising questions about their commitment to peaceful coexistence. **Source:** [The Australian](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/assads-fall-has-delivered-both-hope-and-risk-in-a-newlook-middle-east/news-story/ac2b3495fcf8f1bcee49bc17744fbdc8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Comparative Analysis with Turkey's Actions**\n\nTurkey has also occupied parts of northern Syria, controlling approximately **8,000 square kilometers**, which is about **4.9% of Syria's territory**. **Source:** [Middle East Forum](https://www.meforum.org/middle-east-quarterly/when-will-turkey-annex-northern-syria?utm_source=chatgpt.com). This occupation includes populated cities such as **Afrin**, with significant civilian populations. **Source:** [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/3adcaa2b9b214465bb9e61d8427ab774?utm_source=chatgpt.com). In contrast, Israel's occupation of the buffer zone involves a less populated area, primarily established for security purposes.\n\n# Discussion Points\n\n1. **Reasonableness of Israel's Security Concerns:** Given the recent upheaval in Syria and the emergence of potentially hostile groups near its border, Israel's security concerns appear justified. The occupation of the buffer zone can be seen as a precautionary measure to prevent hostile forces from establishing a presence adjacent to Israeli territory.\n2. **Perception of Unfairness in International Response:** The international community's focus on Israel's actions, while comparatively less attention is given to Turkey's more extensive occupation of Syrian territory, suggests a potential double standard. Factors such as geopolitical alliances and cultural affiliations may influence this disparity in scrutiny.\n\nI appreciate data driven arguments with references from leading journals and papers with a good score on GroundNews.",

                        "text": "But that doesn't make sense. The UN buffer zone is there to prevent attacks directly on the buffer zone known as the Golan Heights, which is a buffer zone manned by Israeli troops, right? But if the former UN buffer zone is now manned by Israeli troops, there is still no buffer zone between Israeli troops and the possible attackers. Or does Israel expect the UN now to occupy a new buffer zone between the Israelis and the Syrians?\n\nIf that doesn't happen (and I don't expect it will), it shouldn't matter from an Israeli perspective whether the attacks happen on Israeli troops in the original Golan Heights buffer zone, or in the former UN bufferzone. Taking the former UN buffer zone does not enhance security for Israeli troops at all. In fact, given that this can easily become a pretext for Syrian militants to now attack the Israeli troops in their newly occupied Syrian territory, I would argue it makes Israeli troops less safe than before. Golan Heights were the somewhat accepted status quo. This is not.\n\nBut perhaps that is the goal of Netanyahu. Do a provocative move to occupy a new part of Syria, wait for the inevitable attacks and then distract the Israeli public with having to strike back at 'the enemy'.",

Alright we will invade some of Portugal, set up a militarised buffer zone so that in order for Portugal to be attacked they will have to first go through our military buffer\u201d\n\nIn this situation would you support a Portuguese buffer zone and call it a buffer zone as opposed to more Portugal ? \n\nPlease note I am not arguing this is the situation in Israel and Syria right now, although I personally believe it is, I am just arguing specifically that this is a buffer zone and not just more Portugal, or more Israel.",

This is really hurting Israel's claim to be a nation in defense; if your defense requires claiming more territory that's no longer a defense really, it's an offense. As they do so, surrounding countries will increasingly react out of fear that they could be next to suffer the wrath of the super powerful and brutal Israeli armed forces. Countries that fear extinction or loss of significant territory will continue to radicalize and the cycle of violence will escalate further, causing more Oct 7 like events. Based on Israeli government's words and actions, it does seem like it is the case that Israel's long term goals include acquiring more land.\n\nIf Israel came out flat and said \"we are on an expansion campaign because we feel the surrounding governments are weak and we can seize power\" maybe people would be angry but at least nobody could accuse them of deceiving.

        "text": "Israeli here. Attacking a regime that did nothing to attack you is not only wrong, it's bad from a national security viewpoint. The best way for Israel to secure its Syrian border is through diplomacy with the new regime. If the new regime declares war on Israel, it's going to be painful to Israel regardless of whether Israel holds some small bits of territory here and there. Nothing Israel can reasonably capture is of enough strategic value to offset the relationship losses with the new regime and the rest of the world.\n\nRight now, the new regime has no reason to attack Israel and every reason to seek cooperation. Attacking them changes that. You can't expect a country who is truly threatened by Israel to seek peaceful relations with Israel. It also undermines the legitimacy of Israel's  recent wars when we attack a country who did nothing to us, as opposed to October 7th and the relentless bombing from Hezbollah.\n\nFinally, I want to express my exasperation in people feeling the need to cover for our terrible government. You know they aren't doing it for real security reasons. On one hand you have Netanyahu who would do anything to escape trial, conveniently starting the engagement in Syria a few days before he was set to testify in court, and actually using it as an excuse to seek a delay. On the other hand you have the crazies Ben Gvir and Smotrich, who probably just want to conquer as much territory as possible and annex it at some point. I realize the need to defend Israel because some of the attacks on us are truly unreasonable, but this time the critics have a point.",

        "text": "I'll weigh in on the perceived unfairness of the international response.\n\nIsrael has a long history of \"temporary\" occupations for ostensible security concerns that turn out not to be so temporary, and which have produced tragic consequences for those on the receiving end. The West Bank is the now fifty-seven-year \"temporary\" occupation that tends to get the most attention, due to the extensive civilian settlements and military administration that many, including Israeli human rights groups, describe as a regime of apartheid. Land has been expropriated, access to resources as basic as water has been limited, and much of the local population lives under military governance without civil rights or due process. Though there is debate about whether Gaza (at least until late last year) should be described as occupied, many attribute the rise of Hamas and the formation of the situation there to the conditions of Israel's \"temporary\" occupation there up to 2005, with similar conditions to the West Bank. In the past, Israel's \"temporary\" occupation of the Sinai included the displacement of local residents and the construction of Israeli civilian settlements, and it took a war in 1973 (and an international oil embargo) for Egypt and its allies to pressure Israel to the table to negotiate peace and a withdrawal. There is also the occupation of the part of the Golan heights that Israel annexed in 1981. Perhaps the more closely analogous situation, however, would be Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the eighteen-year invasion that followed. There, too, there was a civil war into which Israel intervened, in that case with the aim of expelling the PLO from south Lebanon. In its initial campaign, it killed some 20,000 people and backed local proxies who, under its protection, carried out pogroms in Palestinian refugee camps among other terrorist violence inflicted on civilians in that territory. One enduring consequence of that invasion and occupation is that some Shiites in south Lebanon formed a militia to resist the Israeli aggression, i.e., Hezbollah, which many view as a net negative for the region and its stability. When many folks around the world now see Israel rush into Syria, beyond the strategic territory of the Golan even, they can't help but feel like they're seeing a rerun of a show they've seen a few times before. And many express concerns based on that past experience.\n\nI don't know what the future holds. Perhaps Israel will neutralize certain offensive weapons capabilities, establish security agreements with the new government, and withdraw. But given the Israel's track record with this sort of thing, I don't think it is unfair for international audiences to raise concerns about the aims and scope of Israel's occupation of Syrian territory until that happens.",

You seem to agree with Syria but that doesn't make it any less contested. Contested means this.  \n  \n\\> If Israel didn't have a long, long, long, **long** history of taking land for \"security concerns\" and then never giving it back, people wouldn't be so mad.\n\nWell Israel has a long history of also giving back land for peace. Look at the Sinai with Egypt. That was occupied by Israel no? Look at Gaza (before Oct 7). That was disengaged from in 2006 no? Look at southern Lebanon (before the recent war). That was occupied and then disengaged from no? It seems to me that, if anything, Israel has been willing to exchange land for security when the conditions allow for it.\n\n\\> Do ya think Israel is ever gonna give back the \"buffer zone\" to Syria, who owns the land?\n\nWhat I think has little relevance. I wrote what I think in the post. About this I really don't know because it depends on HTS and who they decide is their biggest enemy and who they want to cooperate with. They are at a crossroads of history. Will they cooperate with the Iranians against Israel? Will they keep fighting the Iranians? Will they accept any Israeli help in fighting the Iranians? I think all of these points are potentially on the table, but really if they are smart about it they should focus on reconstructing their country so that it may be free from threats internal and external as opposed to fighting well establish foreign armies. If you're asking if there's going to be a push from the right to settle those areas then the answer is no. A considerable part of the arguments for settling WB and Gaza is that Jews used to live there, it's part of the ancient kingdom of Israel, so if Jews want to live there they should be able to. These do not apply to the same extent to the buffer zone with Syria.",

    "text": "Disclosure: I don't identify myself within the plural community. Some of my friends do, however. Also, a lot of people in the community will probably find my usage of terminology to be a offensive, but that's mostly because it's hard to describe this all to a layperson- though I'm still hoping that none of my plural friends stumble upon this because this is a less unfiltered expression of my opinions.\n\nI've been aware of the concept for a long time, now but it's only recently that I've looked into it because I've gotten to actually know some people (albiet only online) that claim to be plural. I thought it was odd but mostly innocuous, because the members of their systems tend to function quite well- they tend to share memories, don't fight a lot, they talk to one another, and some of them even date each other- it doesn't feel like a \\*disordered\\* existence because it's not causing them any new issues functioning, as far as I know. \n\nThey believe that you don't nessesarily require Dissociative Idenity Disorder to have multiple \"personalities\" and that there are more ways to be, essentially, multiple people in one- for instance, that the brain can just create new people, and that the process doesn't nessesarily require trauma, though some of them were made to deal with trauma and stress. Some others are formed as childhood friends or original characters that took a life of their own or tulpas. Some others are, like, from esoteric spiritual beliefs (past lives, etc) which I don't really believe in.\n\nThey kind of encouraged me to explore plurality a bit but it never felt like I was being pressured or whatever, and when I decided that I wasn't, they were like, cool, sure. It's not really as cultish as some people say they are- it's just a community of young folk with a very different form of self-identification. \n\nWhen I say self-identification I generally mean that in the end every human mind contains multitudes to some degree- I.E code switching and the such, and that these people simply have a more extreme version of it. Lots of people talk to themselves or give personalities to their inner critic. Some authors \"talk to\" the characters they write. I feel like when someone says that they're \"multiple people,\" it's because that's the most comfortable lens to view themselves through, and thinking like that works for them. \n\nLike, I don't really \\*get\\* how someone can have, like, versions of fictional characters (or even real people) in their heads. I don't get the idea of exomemories (having memories of the character's backstory.) I don't get how someone keeps track of like 300+ identities and how they date each other. I don't \\*get\\* any of it but I'm a firm believer of live and let live, and I don't think that they're hurting anyone and I don't really understand why so many people get together on, say r/SystemsCringe to poke fun at them. Most of them aren't saying they have DID either, so it's not nessesarily hurting people with DID by faking diagnosis either. \n\nThere are a lot of terms I don't know how to describe, but [https://morethanone.info/](https://morethanone.info/) is a good resource, as is [https://pluralpedia.org](https://pluralpedia.org) and r/plural",

        "text": "I don\u2019t want to beat around the bush here for anyone reading this thread. The current consensus is that Dissociative Identity Disorder is not \u201cI have multiple personalities\u201d but more \u201cI have less than one personality.\u201d A person with DID is most often dissociating from themselves as a mechanism of coping with trauma. Whatever trauma they have experienced is so massive and monumental that the collective whole of their identity cannot bear it, so it fragments into smaller parts of memory, personality, behavior, mood, etc. that can independently be distanced from the trauma and stand a better chance at surviving long enough to hopefully receive help. It\u2019s practically a neurological manifestation of the adrenal response to danger - fight, flight, freeze, or fawn when the physical threat is in front of you. Add \u201cfracture\u201d to that when the threat also poses a mental danger.\n\nThe fragments of personality and identity that bubble up and float down are then reassembled into other \u201cidentities\u201d which is less a reality of \u201cthis person exists inside of me\u201d and more \u201cit is most beneficial to my emotional and mental stability at this moment that the facets of myself that I am capable of expressing right now are summarized and given distinct form so that I can separately manage them.\u201d To be clear, the alters \u201cexist\u201d only as much as the single human being and the myriad parts of them exist, but they are not real in a literal sense. A person with DID does not literally have a little girl and an old man and a brave warrior and (in the case of people with fictional characters) a cartoon or a book protagonist or so forth inside of them. They have a literally broken psyche where the best and safest ways to reassemble the parts without exposing too many of those parts to the trauma is to create new buckets to put them in and giving those buckets identities of their own.\n\nDID is an aggregating mental illness that has a wide berth of correlations, from depression and anxiety, to depersonalization and mood swings, and the manifestation of it is highly dependent on the society and culture surrounding that person. It\u2019s worth noting that \u201cfictive\u201d identities would not exist in the absence of the cultural touchstones that form them, meaning they are not a direct symptom of the underlying illness (aka someone with diabetes has a problem with insulin regulation whether they live in 2020s America or 1800s Japan).\n\nI am not trying to dismiss anyone\u2019s mental health whatsoever. I want to make it clear that someone with DID has a treatable illness and must receive treatment for it. That treatment may, in the short term, include supporting the existence of the alters and adjusting relational behaviors accordingly. But long term, the goal of therapy is to fuse the fragments back together to create a cohesive whole.\n\nIf someone with DID is not in active therapy right now with an overarching goal of reintegrating them and bringing them back to personalization, they have an extremely low chance of untreated recovery, and an extremely high chance of harm either to themselves or to others, up to and including suicide (more than 70% of DID patients have made a self-harm or suicide attempt in their lives).\n\nIn short, \u201csystems\u201d are more often than not a manifestation of severe trauma and they should not be considered normal or healthy.",

I'd offer you a delta, but you did largely reinforce my view rather than change it.\n\nI was curious, though, since you seem to be knowledgeable on the subject: are people suffering from this condition generally aware of their mental state? The very few people identifying plural that I have interacted with seemed relatively normal, aside from changing their names and various preferences from time to time. It didn't really hit me as DID, to be honest. Meanwhile, in my professional capacity as a former public defender, I have dealt with a lot of people with DID or schizophrenia. I don't know that any of them really ever understood that they were mentally ill. And, thus, it seems to me that the modern pluralism movement is something entirely separate. I'm not sure what, though.",

That is not to say that these issues hadn't always existed in various cultural settings before, but, for instance, the idea of introjects- that is, having versions of characters or other people in one's head- seems to be a new thing. But just because it's \"artificial\" doesn't really mean that it's, like, not real, right? Still, I understand what you mean- I've read an article that describes DID as a \"social contagion\" that spreads by exposure- and while I don't wholly agree with that statement I do think that plurality as a cultural thing would be next to nonexistant beyond certain spiritual beliefs if not for the internet.\n\nWhat I disagree with still is your use of the word performance- I think performance implies a level of manipulation and deliberateness. Many people in the community are neurodivergent, and from what I've seen, some of them didn't want to adopt these identities, like, they'd watch a show and they'll pop into their heads against their will, which distresses them, even though they're normally OK with being plural. But I do admit that I only have their words on it, and that I might be being lied to, or that they might've misinterpreted, for instance, intrusive thoughts, etc...",

        "text": "So, up front, I should say that regardless of my personal beliefs about the merits of their position, all people have the right to believe as they wish and self-determine. Please do not take anything that I am about to write as a condemnation, generally, of these peoples' freedom or right to self-determination.\n\nThat having been said, I do think that there are some dangers in delving too far into pluralism. To a certain extent, we all do engage in it. I mean, I'm not the same person that I was as a 19 year old. Most people aren't. We grow over the course of our lives. We often will mentally imagine what it would be like to be somebody different. Those are all healthy.\n\nBut, given that disassociation and schizophrenia are often comorbidities, and the debilitating effect that schizophrenia can have on people, I am very reluctant to say that fully embracing disassociation is healthy. I am admittedly not particularly well-versed in the literature and would welcome some folks proving me wrong. But, it seems to me that \"fully embracing\" pluralism risks the same sort of disorganized thinking that is the hallmark of schizophrenia. \n\nThat isn't to say that most people who identify as plural are schizophrenic. Most aren't. But I do think that encouraging people writ large to embrace pluralism would resonate the loudest with those at risk of developing schizophrenia. Separating fantasy from reality is incredibly necessary. It's even more necessary these days, with the temptations of fantasy that the internet offers. And, I fear that those who are embracing multiple personalities are doing so to escape the reality that they find themselves in. It seems like it would be much more effective to encourage people to become the sort of person that they wish that they were.\n\nI'm no psychologist. It's entirely possible that I'm coming at this from a place of complete ignorance. If so, I apologize. But, before we start encouraging pluralism, I feel like it would be wise for us to do some psychological studies on how that can affect people who may be prone to schizophrenia already. I also feel like it would be wise for us to study whether pluralism can exacerbate some of the ill psychological effects that social media presents. If those studies show that it is, indeed, perfectly healthy, then by all means. But until we have that research, I am hesitant to say that we should encourage people to embrace it.\n\nOne last thing: when I say that I am hesitant to encourage people to embrace it, I am not speaking in any way about tolerance for people who are plural. I think that they should be given full acceptance, tolerance, and support. I simply think that it is imprudent to encourage those who don't identify as plural to try to do so.",

In other ways, trying to understand our own mental health is a fool's errand, and it takes an outside observer to really understand what is going on with some people. \n\nI also feel like there is a lot of uncertainty wrapped around the label \"plural\". It seemingly includes a lot of people who just like being able to shift preferences without explanation, and it seemingly includes a lot of seriously ill individuals. It's entirely plausible that there is a healthy way to go about this if it's something that interests you.

Imagine you are a person with multiple personalities and you have a partner. You cheat on your partner. Your partner is upset. You say \"but personality A is the one you're dating and personality B is the one that cheated so it's ok because personality B isn't dating you and prefers to sleep with someone else. So it's not cheating and you don't get to be upset\". Clearly, this is wrong. Unless it was stated at the beginning of the relationship that the person only feels good in open relationships due to the multiple personalities, it clearly isn't ok to view it this way.\n\nI chose an extreme example, but the general idea is: what you do in your head is your own business as long as it doesn't hurt yourself or others. If people can keep their systems in check to the extent to which they can come across as a more or less consistent and reliable person to other people, indeed nothing wrong with it. Once you can't really trust someone because you don't know which personality you're supposedly dealing with, it becomes a problem for building interpersonal relationships with real people.",

    "text": "So, here we go. First of all, the Oscars, also known as the Academy Awards, are an industry based award awarding the best films from the Hollywood motion picture industry, while the Cannes (or Venice, Berlin, etc.) are film festivals catering to films from all over the world and from all filmmakers, including rising auteurs and independent filmmakers. Think of the Oscars as the \"Employee of the Year\" awards and the film festivals as World Expos. Cannes will definitely represent the global art scene even more. Second, since the Oscars were primarily industry awards voted by other people in the industry, it is basically a self-congratulatory circlejerk. They just give awards to the films that their colleagues/friends, or popular businessmen (such as Harvey Weinstein) made. In fact, a lot of Academy voters don't watch the films at all. In 2015, 7 percent of Academy voters didn't see Whiplash or The Theory of Everything, while 10 percent of Academy voters didn't even see Selma! On the other hand, films in the Cannes Film Festival were screened to the jury. Third, the Oscars were pretty much a pay-to-win contest where Oscar winning films gain popularity and votes due to their marketing and campaigns, not due to their quality. In 1997,  the campaigns of Miramax films covered 40 percent of the 200 pages of Oscar ads. This is unsurprising given that the films of Harvey Weinstein win more oscars and receive more nominations. Cannes film selections may also promote their films in the competition, but they are not promoted as often as Oscar films.  Finally, the choices of films made at the Oscars over the years were mostly safe choices and safe picks that cater to the demographics of Oscar voters, such as biopics, war films, historical dramas, and relationship stories, and their awards are primarily catered toward producers and wealthy businessmen. Film festivals select a more diverse range of artistic and creative avant-garde films from auteur artists. This is why Parasite, the first and only foreign film to win the Oscar for Best Picture, is the most creative and greatest film to win the award.",

Parasite wasn't released in the US until October, a full six months *after* Cannes. This just doesn't make sense as a mass appeal viewing event like the Oscars does.\n\n\nPlus, the reason most people watch the Oscars is for the pageantry anyway. Your normal people on the couch haven't heard of half the best picture films anyway. To get them to care about the Cannes awards ceremony, I think the production would have to stoop to a level that the French might not approve of :)",

    "text": "Here are expanded arguments supporting the idea that there is no inherent moral limit on wealth:\n\n1. Wealth Is Earned Through Voluntary Exchange\n\nMutual Agreement: Wealth accumulation in a free market relies on voluntary exchanges where both parties agree to terms in advance. Customers choose to buy products or services, and employees agree to work for wages. This is a mutually beneficial relationship, not coercion.\n\nScaling Success: Wealth is often the result of doing something acceptable and beneficial on a small scale and then scaling it up. For example, a local store that earns $100,000 in profit on $5 million in sales is seen as reasonable. If that same business owner scales to 30 stores, maintaining similar margins, their wealth grows\u2014but the principle remains the same.\n\nEfficiency and Value: Large companies, like Walmart, often operate on razor-thin margins (e.g., $0.02 profit for every $1.00 spent). Their scale benefits consumers through lower prices and wider availability, demonstrating that wealth creation at scale is not inherently exploitative.\n\n2. Wealth Encourages Bold Risks That Benefit Society\n\nCapital for Innovation: Significant wealth enables individuals and companies to take courageous risks that smaller entities cannot afford. For instance, billionaires often fund groundbreaking research, such as life-changing medical advancements or technologies that shape industries (e.g., electric vehicles, space exploration).\n\nPhilanthropic Impact: Wealth allows for large-scale charitable contributions that can tackle systemic issues like poverty, education, or disease. Examples include major philanthropic initiatives like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed billions to global health and development.\n\nEconomic Growth: Wealthy entrepreneurs reinvest in businesses, creating jobs and opportunities for others. Their ability to take risks often leads to new industries, technological advancements, and societal progress.\n\n3. The Wealthy Contribute Disproportionately to Taxes\n\nTax System Design: Progressive tax systems ensure that higher-income individuals pay a larger percentage of their earnings in taxes. For example, in the U.S., the top 1% of earners pay a significant share of total income taxes collected.\n\nWealth vs. Income: Critics often confuse wealth (net worth) with income. While wealth is not directly taxed, it fuels investments that generate taxable income and support economic growth. Taxing wealth directly could discourage investment, ultimately harming the economy.\n\nEconomic Redistribution: Taxes collected from high-income earners fund public programs and infrastructure that benefit society as a whole. This demonstrates how wealth, even when concentrated, contributes to broader societal welfare.\n\n4. Moral Consistency\n\n\nFairness in Opportunity: Placing moral limits on wealth implies a cap on what individuals can achieve, even when their success stems from hard work, innovation, and providing value. This could discourage ambition and innovation, which are cornerstones of economic progress.\n\n\nSubjectivity of \u201cToo Much\u201d Wealth: Deciding what constitutes \u201ctoo much\u201d wealth is subjective and inconsistent. Why is $200,000 acceptable for a small business owner but $2 million unacceptable for a larger operation if both operate under similar principles? It seems that those that deem what someone has as too much wealth always select a number larger than what they have.\n\nConclusion\n\nWealth accumulation, when earned through voluntary exchanges and legitimate means, reflects the value provided to society. It fuels innovation, creates opportunities, and supports public systems through taxes. Instead of imposing arbitrary moral limits on wealth, society should focus on ensuring fairness and opportunities for all to succeed.\n\nEdit: formatting fix",

In which case the customer would still be the winner. After all, the customers are the ones who are willingly choosing to go to them that its forcing competitors to close up shop.\n\nIts often stated that they would just charge lower prices until all the competitors are gone and then rack up the prices massively but I really doubt the effectiveness of such a strategy or have seen any real evidence of large firms trying it. Its not an easy or surefire thing to drive other firms out of business due to product differentiation. And if such a strategy succeeds in the short term, in the long term new competitors will just pop up again to take advantage of the higher market price rendering such benefits to be pretty short term.",

You're also far more likely to just be asked to leave than arrested, if you are somehow caught in the vast emptiness of the back country.\n\n>More to the point, you can't claim that all transactions that billionaires engage in are consensual and non-coercive if some transactions are impossible to be non-coercive. \n\nThe significance of these transactions matter. If we apply some standard where any non-coercive transaction results in immorality, then every single person on earth is immoral because either indirectly or directly every transaction can be traced to some degree of coercion. \n\n>It is possible for someone to willingly work at an agreed upon wage, and for that employment agreement to be coercive, because not having that wage would risk death.\n\nThis isn't really the case, though. Not having *a* wage might result in death, but not being employed by the billionaire specifically doesn't necessarily result in death. We also have to consider that many billion dollar companies do not rely on exploitative labour in this way. Tech is a great example, where the workforce commands lucrative wages and can produce extreme value for owners. Someone with an in demand skill-set worth $150k/yr isn't going to starve if one particular billionaire doesn't employ them. That's before we even consider the fact that alternative employment opportunities likely exist.",

There are cultural and geographical hurdles that can only be addressed through proper Government policy and generational change. It's something we are trying to correct over the last few decades but have only observed less distribution of wealth over this time. \n\nThe issues you list surrounding net worth capping are valid. I doubt there is any one silver bullet implementation. I think there should be some assurances or treasuries available that guarantee any wealth generated over the cap can be accessed for purposes that align with the Governments core fundamental expenditure, e.g. R&D, education, infrastructure, etc. for example Elon wanting to create spaceX meets more than one of these categories, and he will be allowed to fund this venture with that money. If a cap is exceeded, and then wealth falls under that cap, they must reach that cap again, wait a fixed period of time or utilise saved funds like above",

The person receiving all that wealth didn't do anything commensurate to earn it. They just owned things. Owning something isn't creating value.\n\n2. Most groundbreaking research isn't done in businesses, it's done in publicly funded universities. And even when it is, it's usually still heavily subsidized. Additionally, plenty of people would happily take risks, if all the ability for risk-taking hadn't been artificially restricted to a few. Also, calling these risks 'courageous' isn't quite right, since the hyper-wealthy aren't risking losing medical care or being able to eat.\n\n3. No one who is a billionaire has had their success stem from 'hard work, innovation, and providing value'. It came from gaining the value of other people's work.",

        "text": "1). \"Voluntary exchange\" under capitalism is not truly voluntary but constrained by the need for workers to sell their labor to survive. Workers create surplus value (the difference between the value of what they produce and their wages), which is appropriated by capitalists as profit. This exploitation is masked by the wage system, which presents the relationship as a fair exchange.\n\nScaling profits often intensifies exploitation, as it requires larger pools of underpaid labor or monopolistic practices that reduce competition. For example, while Walmart may claim thin margins benefit consumers, its low costs often rely on poor wages, precarious working conditions, and aggressive suppression of unions. Additionally, unequal power dynamics means that employers wield significantly more power than employees, which undermines the fairness of \"mutual agreement.\" These power imbalances are structural, not incidental, and perpetuate inequality.\n\n2. Innovation and technological advancement are the results of collective social effort, including publicly funded education, infrastructure, and government-supported research (e.g., NASA\u2019s role in early space technology, or the European Union's approach to funding medical research). When billionaires \"invest,\" they are often leveraging public resources to privatize the gains while socializing the risks/losses. Philanthropy becomes a tool for shaping society according to the donor\u2019s priorities rather than democratic needs.\n\nThe concentration of wealth in private hands often stifles progress by prioritizing profit over societal benefit. For example, life-saving drugs may be priced out of reach for many because of profit motives, despite the wealth of those funding their development. Or alternatively, billionaires have co-opted much of the global talent in stem cell research with vast private funding to develop life prolonging treatments that will become private IP under proprietary private corporations. as opposed to publicly funded research which hopes to cure lifetime disease for the benefit of the general population.\n\n3. .The fact that the wealthy pay a significant share of taxes does not address the root problem of how their wealth was accumulated. Taxes redistribute a portion of the wealth created by workers but do not challenge the exploitative mechanisms that generate inequality. Even when taxes fund public programs, these programs often serve capitalist interests (e.g., subsidizing industries, maintaining infrastructure for commerce) rather than addressing working-class needs.\n\n4. Wealth accumulation becomes immoral because it stems from exploitation, perpetuates inequality, and undermines collective well-being. Capitalist wealth is not a neutral measure of value creation; it represents the privatization of social resources and labor. Even if wealth contributes to philanthropy or economic growth, the structural harm it causes\u2014by commodifying human labor, concentrating power, and prioritizing profit over people\u2014outweighs any perceived benefits.",

To maintain that wealth, they must colonize natural resources and extract the value of their workers to create that \"creation at scale.\" All of this to enrich themselves to have more financial influence than most small nations. With no upper limit on how much they should acquire or how it should be leveraged. These are the personality traits of a sociopath.\n\nThese systems contradict each other and those with the most capital spin a very convincing tale of meritocracy to cover the tracks of exploitation.",

As far back as 2001, the average wage for a Walmart Sales Clerk was $8.23 per hour, or $13,861 a year, while the federal poverty line for a family of three was $14,630. Sam Walton himself said \"I pay low wages. I can take advantage of that. We're going to be successful, but the basis is a very low-wage, low-benefit model of employment.\" Walmart paid out $352m in 2008 to settle lawsuits over wage violations.\n\nThe reason that Walmart can pay such ridiculously low wages is because of the existence of the social welfare net, and the desperation of those in poverty. Basically, [Walmart is getting subsidized by the government. ](https://www.gao.gov/assets/d2145.pdf)\n\nYou claim that 'only 0.69%' of their staff is on welfare.

        "text": "> Mutual Agreement: Wealth accumulation in a free market relies on voluntary exchanges where both parties agree to terms in advance. Customers choose to buy products or services, and employees agree to work for wages. This is a mutually beneficial relationship, not coercion.\n\nThis is probably the heart of any debate on the inherent morality of wealth accumulation, and it's certainly a matter of significant debate over economic systems. The counterargument would be that participation within the market economy under capitalism is functionally mandatory, due to the need for food and shelter, and due to the fact it is impossible to lawfully obtain these things (barring charity) without either owning capital or selling labor.\n\nThere is no choice to leave the market entirely and survive independent of it, and therefore the relationship to it is involuntary. The customer must purchase products and services to live, and thus must seek employment for the wages necessary to make those purchases. To reject this is to threaten their survival. It is coercive.\n\nTo tie this to the thesis, someone who has accrued $1,000,000,000 in wealth in contemporary US currency must have benefited from a very large number of these relationships. That wealth is therefore obtained through a large number of involuntary exchanges.\n\nThe only moral defense is that perhaps these relationships were relatively less immoral than others, but I think this is a naive approach. In a coercive relationship, morality is judged by the extent to which the coerced participant benefits, relative to other such relationships. But to obtain such quantities of wealth requires a desire to maximize the benefit for the coercive partner. In a complex system this can involve tradeoffs i.e. a business can lower the price of goods but must offset this with lower wages.\n\nAnd to maximize profits (required for such wealth accumulation) this is only done for a specific purpose, such as undercutting the competition until such a point that the market will support raising prices (but not wages) without negatively impacting profit.\n\nThere have always been moral philosophies which seek to frame the accumulation of wealth as a moral act, where the very act of accumulation is seen as a noble pursuit. But these are created with purpose to defend wealth. In a framework where morality is determined by humanist principles wealth at scale requires large amounts of immoral acts.",

Wealth Encourages bold risks that benefit society\n\nThis statement is true - but is not evidence for why billionaires need to exist. This role existed before billionaires. Mostly banks, motivated by profit, but also regulated by government, made loans based on ideas and business plans. Bankruptcy exist as a way to forgive those who take risks and fail. Only condition to fulfill your 3 cases is that wealth is created, not that it's held by a singular person. Capital for innovation could be just part of a bank, or government programs for small or medium businesses, grants for universities. Philanthropic impact, even by billionaires are done through charities, which the billionaire only acts as a middleman for. Reinvestment into business is done at the business level, not at the individual billionaire level. Tesla takes their earnings and reinvests, Elon Musk does not take his personal money and reinvest into Tesla since it's been public.\n\n3. The wealthy contribute disproportionately to taxes\n\nSimilar to above - yes this statement is true, but not an evidence to why billionaires need to exist. Progressive tax brackets stops much sooner than CEO pay. If we wanted to expand the brackets, or add new brackets where after maybe 10M you're taxed at 90% you could justify people getting 10M in salary. The marginal difference in tax dollars collected between one person making 10M/year and 20 people making 500K a year is minimal. One is much more likely to produce billionaires the other is not.\n\nWealth v income - I agree here a bit, but capital gains should be higher, like muuuuuch higher. People might say that would also discourage investment, but I think having your $100k sitting in a bank is worse than having 100K invested, making 10K and getting taxed 9k, so you make 1K... because 0 dollar is less than 1 K, people will still invest.\n\nSimilar point as point 2 - billionaire is not a requirement. Only wealth creation is required for public programs. Billioniares just work as a middleman between the wealth and the \"programs\" that fund things. \n\n  \nConclusion\n\nMost of the benefits you cite on points 2 and 3 from having Billionaires actually does not require billionaires for it to be true. Wealth can be created, distributed differently, and these things will still hold. There are side effect to having billionaires such as extreme inequality. There is a causal relationship between inequality and crime (gini coefficient and crime). I don't think having billionaire is all bad or evil, but i think it is a tradeoff of pros and cons. Once you take away some of the Pros you mentioned as I don't see them as real pros of billionaires, but only of wealth creation, the calculus may change, or I would at least posit you to re-examine your stance, even if you end up at the same conclusion, maybe you'll have a weaker conclusion than before..",

You are romanticizing wealth creation as a product of innovation and hard work, are deliberately ignoreing the profound systemic barriers that prevent equitable economic participation.\n\n**Voluntary exchange:** True voluntary exchange requires genuine economic agency, which is systematically undermined by generational wealth, structural racism, educational inequity, and concentrated economic power. A worker 'choosing' between minimum wage jobs and potential destitution is not engaging in a freely negotiated transaction, but surviving within a constrained economic system. Your response to this has been 'They can go live in teh woods' or start their own business. Both of which are optoins that only someone who is very naive would suggest. I can go into more detail here if you really cant understand why living in the woods or starting one's own business might not be possible for a single parent of 2 who is struggling to make ends meet.\n\n**Philanthropy:** The philanthropic angle mentioned is also quite disingenuous. Billionaire \"charity\" represents a minuscule fraction of wealth extracted through labor exploitation, tax avoidance, and market monopolization. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, for instance, operates as a strategic tax shelter that allows continued wealth accumulation while providing a veneer of social responsibility.\n\n**Taxation:** This claim severely obscures the reality of sophisticated tax avoidance strategies employed by the wealthy. Yes, the rich give a lot of tax. But AS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR WEALTH, they contribute next to nothing. Elon Musk paid 3.6% in federal taxes between 2014 - 2018, while his net worth grew by $15b. And this is doubly true for companies. [In fact, 10% of the S&P500 paid absolutely no tax in 2023](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp-500-companies-paid-no-tax/), and this includes companies such as Tesla, AirBnB and Pfizer. Corporations and high-net-worth individuals routinely leverage loopholes, offshore accounts, and complex financial mechanisms to minimize their societal contributions.\n\nYou have way too many points in your CMV, and all of them are fundamentally misguided. I would suggest we pick one aspect and go deep into it. Otherwise I think this conversation is going to go nowhere.",

The biggest businesses (read billionaire owned) have the largest reach and highest employment. When you are living paycheck to paycheck, you don't have a lot of flexibility in the kind of employer you would like to have. I hope you are young, because otherwise I would have to say that you are completely unexposed to how the world operates.\n\n>When funds are in a charity it is illegal to use for personal use (other than if you work there)\n\nI don't think you fully understand how charitable donations work to reduce tax liability. Let me give you an example. In 2021, Elon Musk donated $5.7 billion in Tesla shares to his foundation. The\u00a0[federal tax benefits](https://news.bloombergtax.com/tax-insights-and-commentary/elon-musks-5-7-billion-stock-gift-had-some-surprising-benefits)\u00a0of his donation amounted to about $4.6 billion, or almost exactly 30 percent of his adjusted gross income \u2014 the maximum he would be allowed to deduct. So basically, Musk paid $1.1b to save $4.6b. In other words, Musk got 80% value for the charity that he did. The average person has no such recourse.\n\n>I agree with you, end the corporate welfare.\n\nBut it won't. Because it's the billionaires who control policy-making. Chalk that up to another reason for immorality.\n\n>Should number 3 be accomplished, why should we eliminate billionaires?\n\nThe CMV is not about whether we should eliminate billionaires.

                        "text": "I don't think this is valid logic. Billionaire businesses push out other options. Walmart pushed out mom n pop stores. Uber pushed out regular taxis. AirBnB pushed out motels and bed n breakfasts. So the only thing is that bargaining power is concentrated in the few. In their absence there would be other businesses to fill in the void, just as there was before.\n\nEdit: One more point to note - each of the three businesses I mentioned could grow so large and push out other businesses through extralegal practices. Uber and AirBnB took advantage of the lack of legal frameworks in their industry. Walmart could grow so large through union-busting and lack of legal support for minimum wages.",

                            "text": "It\u2019s true the bargaining power is concentrated - this can lead to bad outcomes, some of which is mitigated by unions. But you can also see each of these \u201cpush out\u201ds as a value creation event. Two ways to look at it depending on your philosophy:\n\n1. For the push out to happen, consumers must have gotten value from the switch. And subsequently a small part of that value was returned to the businesses. Distilled, this is a matter of saying, is it in the consumer\u2019s right to want progress and value? If yes, then these mom-and-pops would\u2019ve become history anyway at some point as it\u2019s the consumer\u2019s right to decide who to give their money to.\n\n2. If no, then your philosophy in some way wants society to stagnate. Or if you want to look at it from the perspective of counterfactuals or what ifs, there are plenty of other countries where they take this exact position - ie \u201cregulators and government should decide rather than consumers\u201d. A lot of these countries eventually become resource producers or tourism centers - ie those mom and pops go away anyway.\n\nEDIT: just saw your edit. They can\u2019t be called \u201cextra legal\u201d if they\u2019re illegal. For the most part all the things you described are legal. We may wish for higher standards but within boundaries of the law that\u2019s what we should expect. Uber and airBnB in particular have spurred changes in the regulations. And they now operate within this new regime, as do any competitors that follow. Often times in an unregulated environment, if you choose to be the ones to have a higher standard, you\u2019re essentially choosing to be outcompeted.",

    "text": "So I'm under the impression that increasingly in America (and probably most of \"the west\") White fixation politics is misguided because the elite is no longer pro-White and the same with \"Male fixation politics.\"   In America, several immigrant groups out-earn native born Americans of European descent.   Women are now serious contenders for the highest power positions in America and they've achieved it in other Western Countries.  There's been a partially Black President in America.   Corporations are filled with multiracial leaders.   Many native born Whites are poor.  Men do outearn Women on average in America, but Men and Women don't work the same types of jobs.\n\nYet there definitely was a time in American history where big farm business imported slave labor to create an underclass and divide Black workers against White workers (in Amerca).   I don't deny that this time existed.   I don't deny that for a long time, Women weren't taken seriously as employees and were dependent on their husbands.  That time existed.   That time is not now.\n\nI just think we're passed that.   I think in today's society, your race and sex no longer determine your class position.   Race has become severed from class.   There is a large population of Blacks who are economically marginalized, but increasingly as individuals Blacks are starting to rise into high places just not as a group.     I really think what we have is a class divide that is holding down a lot of people as opposed to a pro-white politics that needs to be countered with an anti-white politics.  The legacy of slavery may have helped shape that class divide, but institutionally there's no pro-white policy in America and the West and most people \"want\" to see Blacks do well.\n\nedit: The post put the tag \"election\" on it, but I didn't add that tag myself.   This post only marginally deals with the election.\n\nDeltas were given because some comments prompted me to do research and I found that at the very super-elite level, White Men still dominate, even relative to Asians.   To an impoverished person like me, the standards of what I consider \"elite\" are lower, but I took a look at the very top.   This doesn't mean that I think society is openly White Supremacist or Patriarchal, but the very top of society sways in the direction of Whites and Men.  Not the well off, but the truly elite.",

Because the 1001-2000 most qualified people to be on boards would be mostly white men. You'd need an entire generation of people who grew up in the non-racist/non-sexist system for the top 1% or the bottom 1% to be representative.

                    "text": "So, it's basically impossible to get rid of racism/sexism because history will always exist short of a catastrophic event (and sometimes even through catastrophic events). We can never fully get rid of historical impact of anything. I mean, look at Egypt, they're benefitting from the fact that 5000 years ago the people who lives there were forced to make the pyramids.\n\nWe'll probably never agree on this. I disagree that as long as history has an effect it means it still exists. That would imply every other country will always be racist as well. To me it seems like a very west-centric view, since America was/is one of the first to become more multi-cultural than most. Country I'm originally from now has an influx of immigrants from other countries, and they're working out how to give everyone rights. Because of this discrimination being more recent, you're implying that this country will be more racist than the US because it's more recent history, which will always have more impact than older history.\n\nIf not racism, the US would've picked some other attribute to discriminate. It's sort of human nature. This isn't a philosophical argument but an empirical one. Once a group is big/populous enough, they always splinter into groups and discriminate. China has prejudices and even limitations based on your home-town. India has the caste system. Even countries as \"small\" as Japan or Korea has prejudices and very strict and severe nepotism based on regional origins. These are mostly single ethnic groups, and they historically restric/enslave people based on stuff just as stupid and uncontrolable as race, your home town. \n\nOnly tangentially related - I honestly believe that part of the political divide we see is because the US has gotten past a lot of other discrimination, but our base desire to tribalize is still there. Tribalism based on race, sex, or other stuff is obviously not okay, so we pick something that is acceptable to tribalize around- politics.",

You think that suddenly disappeared? That's why affirmative action existed, that was society and the justice system collectively going. Yes, we did something that kept a specific population down through economic vehicles, so we are leveling the playing field, through evening out their ability to access education.\n\nThem now taking it away again, after the Naval Academy came back and said, NOPE that weakens our ability to lead in combat, will show in the future that this will be looked at the same way people looked at racists during MLK's time.\n\nI'm a Caucasian male, and it's not hard to see that even though I grew up poor I still had privilege because my sister was adopted, so I got to watch how a Pacific Islander was treated, even though she's been a US citizen since she was 8 weeks old when my mom adopted her, while she was stationed overseas.\n\nYou are utilizing exceptionalism to try and justify isms don't exist. I've worked in fortune 100 companies, where my managers who were women, had me pitch the idea, because they knew with our executive team, wouldn't listen to them. So they had me do it, and frankly my career got pushed a lot further ahead than it should of solely because, am guy.\n\nThese men who did this out in the open before didn't just disappear, they are still in power. They've just been waiting for it to be okay to say it loud and proud again. There is always pushback against progressivism because often people in power see it as a zero sum game.\n\nWhy do you think so many historians right now are losing their mind? We are quite literally speed running the 1920's into the 1930's. We were making great strides for personal freedoms and true equality, because a dominant ethno-state may change, we're giving into isolationism, dangerous divisiveness, and hatred.\n\nWhy because a bunch of white dudes are afraid our kids can eat seasoned food, maybe get to grow up bi-lingual, and not get sun burnt as easily?

A fashionable 'redlining' for these times. \n\nSold as \"freedom of choice\", school vouchers \"empower\" each family to make decisions about where their children are educated and as a direct consequence,  where tax revenues are spent.  \n\nSome families will chose to top up the voucher amount and send their kids to private schools. They want the best for their kids and can absorb the extra costs.  \n\nOther families will remain in public schools because they don't have additional funds,  whilst the final family subset, the rich, continues educating their offspring in private schools.  \n\nWhat's wrong with that you ask ? Why shouldn't we get those education dollars to spend as we please ? Isn't that freedom ?\n\nWell, the wealthier families that had been paying out of pocket, are now getting a tax payer funded rebate. An extraordinary new benefit of being wealthy.\n\nThe middle class family that choses to  top up the voucher amount, is now no longer supporting the public school system. \n\nThey have less in their pocket now, but hey, that private school is now benefiting from those extra middle class dollars.\n\nPublic funds in private pockets - a la Elon Musk. This of course leaves the public schools severely underfunded,  and in an eternal  doom loop. \n\nNot sure that is freedom they make it out to be. But it would help maintain the status quo.

I see you completely skipped past redlining as the importance of why I used that and it's implication for African American, Irish American, and Italian Americans and don't know the implication of why I used that.  \n  \nI live in the Midwest, with my primary markets being Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Denver, Seattle. I stay away from NYC, since they don't operate in Mid-Markets as much which I already said is my niche. I run a lifestyle business, I stop working once I hit the money number I want for the year. \n\nThe Asian students in most of my programs were closer to a 60/40 split foreign exchange. While yes there were hard working ones, many others of other minority groups were just as hardworking if not more so. Because they didn't have familial support they did it in spite of it. You get defensive because you think it diminishes the work you put in to get to where you are when it doesn't. No one is diminishing your sacrifices. \n\n60 years ago, if people move every 7 years on average that means less than 10 turns of those properties to increase in values at best, they have not and will not have recovered, especially since those properties have not turned every 7 years. You do not understand how long it takes for areas to recover property wise. Meaning those school systems are still decades behind districts that did not experience the detriments of redlining.  Again first hand experience because in my undergrad I volunteered as a STEM tutor for 7-12 for America Reads at a lot of those schools. So I got to see first hand the difference. \n\nThis is another instance, where you don't have a deep expertise on real estate or property valuation, you just see that was X years ago, so it must've been corrected by now! This is an instance where you want a confirmation bias so you will look for the first information that confirms your belief and stop there. Plus I doubt you have any first hand experience tutoring between school districts either. So you are just guessing based on feelings. \n\nI don't care if you buy the story or not, because any woman that's worked in those positions will read it and be like checks out. This is an instance of your IQ out stepping your EQ. You don't want to believe it so you won't. But I believe I have good luck and I just happened to be in the right place at the right time. So I was able to do it and benefited from it.\n\nYou are utilizing exceptionalism \"Phillips Exeter is 35% Asian\" again to try and counter the argument. It's a logical fallacy. To utilize singular instances to disprove entire systems. There are reasons exceptions exist. It's the same as the argument, well now there are 56% multi-racial CEO's so you go straight to quota based arguments on your side. Nowhere have I mentioned quota's that's an entirely conservative talking point. Because it's combative in nature. It's a win-lose / zero-sum talking point. Instead of hey let's make sure we set guidelines in place to prevent unjust biases and improper treatment in the workplace.   \n  \nWe are not attacking you, or your culture. We are not saying you need help, what we are saying however is that there are still systemic practices, behaviors, and lingering after effects from prior issues. \n\nRich people don't transcend anything, they are normal people. To think anything else is dangerously stupid. The honest ones know it's about preparation, timing, and luck. Luck being defined as random variables outside your control falling in your favor. Mixed in with the grit to keep trying until they can land all 3. The most common trait these individuals have is their appetite for risk.\n\nBased off your responses, I looked at your comment history to see if it was worth the time to try and change your view and my perception is it's not worth a further conversation with you. You've already shown a close mindedness. With a perversion of idolization of another subgroup.\n\nI did edit, to counter some of your edits to be more fair to your comment.\n\nMost poor white people, were also negatively impacted by redlining in some capacity as well. It was more widespread that the vast majority of Americans realize. Especially if they live near urban centers.",

Only 4 people who weren't white have been on the Supreme Court - three of them are currently there - three black people (one past) and one Hispanic. If things were actually equal by race and gender, there would be 5 women (Women make up 51% of the US population), and only 5 white people, plus 2 Hispanic, 1 Black, and 1 person who was either Asian, Pacific Islander, or Native American. And historically, out of the 116 justices, 59 or 60 would have been women, and at least 15 would have been each of  African American and Hispanic, plus at least 6 Asian/Pacific Islanders and 2 Native Americans. \n\nIn the history of the US, there has only been one woman elected to the White House, and only two non-White people. While Black people specifically have reached current equity in the 21st century (2 of the 8 people in the White House since 2000 have been Black), Hispanic people have not, nor any other racial minority other than people of Indian descent (Because Harris's mother was from India). If things were equal, we should expect one or two Black people elected to the White House, two Hispanic people, and maybe one person from the Asian/Pacific Islander/Native American group; as well as four women.\n\nAnd [congress doesn't help that](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47470). In the senate in 2024, there are only 24 women out of the 51 we should expect; 3 African Americans out of the 13 we should expect, 5 Hispanics out of the 20 we should expect, 3 Asian/Pacific Islanders out of the 6 we should expect; and 1 Native American - the only minority with equal representation. In the House, out of 438 Representatives, there are only 131 women out of the 223 we should expect, 61 African Americans out of the 57 we should expect (a second moment of equity), 56 Hispanics out of the 88 we should expect, 16 Asian/Pacific Islanders out of the 26 we should expect, and 4 Native Americans (a second moment of equity).\n\nIn other words, between the three branches of US government; only African Americans and Native Americans have any possible claim to racial equity; and despite that, African Americans are still underrepresented in the Senate. Meanwhile, Hispanic people are chronically underrepresented, as are Asians and Pacific Islanders. Meanwhile, White Men are overrepresented in every branch of government.\n\nIf you want me to do the (longer) same evaluation of Fortune 500 leadership or Billionaires, I'm happy to do so, but it will tkae me some time. But the numbers are the same: White men are the majority despite making up only about 30% of the US population, while women and every racial minority are underrepresented.",

I will acknowledge that the US is in a much improved state relative the 1950s and Jim Crow; and were the question about improvement, I think it is entirely appropriate to celebrate the improvement: going from few if any non-white Legislators between the 1880s and the 1960s to proportionate representation of Native Americans in both the House and Senate, and African Americans in the House IS a huge improvement. Going from one non-white occupant of the White House (Curtis) in 1929-1933 to two additional ones representing three additional minorities groups (Obama and Harris, representing African Americans, Indian Americans, and Women) IS huge. Having four women, two Black people, and one Hispanic on the current Supreme court IS a huge improvement.\n\nBut it's not enough. Until there is a lasting record of ALL minority groups being represented, within statistical margins of error, we aren't done. And while I haven't done the same look at every Congress against the general population; I would be highly surprised if there has ever been a Senate or House with more than 1/3 women, or with a racial makeup that did not fail to support the null hypothesis that all races are equally represented at a 99.9% confidence level.",

They have assimilated, particularly when it comes to their view of hierarchies in business and American culture. They continue to reinforce the hierarchies that White European culture created in the US. \n\nHave you ever heard of a Black Person being referred to as \"an Oreo?\" Or a Chinese person as \"a Banana?\" I'm not saying that all of these people are a \"white on the inside\" perfect stereotype, but that stereotype exists for a reason. Clarence Thomas is a prime example of a man who is a traitor to people with the same ethnicity as he has, he has long acted against the interests of Black Americans by adopting the worldview and arguments that were created by and propagated by white elites. \n\nThe world is more complicated than just \"there are a lot of Asian CEOs.\"",

Officers, particularly high level flag rank officers, have always been in the upper tiers of a culture financially and socially.\n\nHe went to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur for his Bachelor's degree, one of the country's best universities.\n\nHere's how closely tied the US is to the specific university the current IBM CEO attended:\n\n>During the first ten years of its existence, a consortium of nine US universities (namely MIT, University of California at Berkeley, California Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan, Ohio State University, Case Western Reserve University and Purdue University) helped set up IIT Kanpur's research laboratories\n\nAlso note the connection to IBM, specifically:\n\n>Under the guidance of economist John Kenneth Galbraith, IIT Kanpur was the first institute in India to offer Computer science education.[8][9] The earliest computer course was started at the institute in August 1963 **on an IBM 1620 system.** The initiative for computer education came from the Electrical engineering department, then under the chairmanship of Prof. H.K. Kesavan, who was concurrently the chairman of Electrical Engineering and head of the Computer Centre. Prof. Harry Huskey of the University of California, Berkeley, who preceded Kesavan, helped[8] with the computer activity at IIT-Kanpur.[8] In 1971, the institute began an independent academic program in Computer Science and Engineering, leading to MTech and PhD degrees.\n\nBuddy, you gotta open your mind a bit.",

Because even if an immigrant comes in at the 50th percentile of income, that's already privileged compared to 50% of people. \n\n\n\n>I don't understand this argument of closely tied to the US\n\nYou don't understand how living in a region of India where the US specifically spent time, money, and resources to create schools might have an impact on some Indians' educational and financial opportunities and how that might affect their worldview on economics and opportunities? \n\nReally? What don't you understand about that? \n\n>It's his non-whiteness that made him successfu\n\nWell now you're saying that it's his race that made him successful, not his skills or talents. What do we normally call that?",

They lost their money in these events, but still had the other benefits of high socioeconomic status. Among these people, some of the most promising and most intelligent individuals were allowed to immigrate to the US. Many of them rebuilt their wealth pretty quickly in the US, leveraging the benefits of high SES in the old country as well as their high intelligence. There's nothing magic about intelligence and socioeconomic status.\n\nIt is totally possible that your family wasn't well off to begin with in the old country, but that's not the experience of all successful Asian people.

Such a refugee who loses their wealth can nevertheless still benefit from their education, their health, their connections, and their experience.\n\n>The reality is people were able to move up in society through hard work.\n\nWell, certainly some people move up in society through hard work, but this is no more true for Asian people than for people of other races. I'm not saying \"don't try because you won't get anywhere,\" I'm saying that \"working harder\" is not the exclusive and only reason Asian people are successful.",

Therefore the median Asian migrant is one with already the economic means to move halfway across the world, and this makes them skew higher in regards to economic status as well as education. Then the second generations still have the generational wealth of their parents.\n\nThis is also why when you break down the 'Asian' umbrella into more granular nationalities, the top three are Indian Americans, Taiwanese, and Filipino.",

A very, very clear cut example of this is in medical school admissions. In 2023, the average hispanic applicant applied with a 53rd percentile MCAT, while the average Asian applicant applied with an 82nd percentile MCAT. In spite of this huge discrepancy, hispanics saw a slightly higher admission rate than asian applicants (49% vs 48% respectively).\n\nBlacks are an interesting case, with the average applicant having a 42nd percentile MCAT and seeing a 41% admission rate. It's tough to say if this favoritism outweighs that of hispanics, but I can tell you for a fact that a 42nd percentile mcat is DOA for an asian applicant. \n\nMaybe one day people will realize that the best way to fight discrimination isn't with more discrimination. That's wishful thinking though lmfao \n\n[Evidence for my first point](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race#:~:text=are%20as%20follows:-,Asian:,%2D%2D%2D%2D)",

        "text": "I think we can show that this country is very sexist and patriarchal by the fact that people (namely men, which compose the majority of pro-lifers) are trying to ban abortion when 1) That\u2019s been proven to be ineffective, in every case throughout history. The abortion rate does not decrease as a result, let alone decrease significantly. And the countries with strict abortion bans actually have a higher rate of abortions on average than the countries with lax restrictions on abortion. And 2) We know that strict abortion bans harm women who need doctors to perform emergency, medically-necessary abortions. And it becomes a witch hunt whenever a woman has a miscarriage, because pro-lifers want her to be investigated as if the miscarriage wasn\u2019t traumatic enough on its own. \n\nSo if we know that there are no real benefits (no decrease in the rate of abortion) but there are real harms to women, why would a large portion of the country (mostly men) be trying to reinstate age-old abortions laws from the 1800\u2019s? And the vast majority of legislators and DA\u2019s trying to force women to give birth, by the way, are also men. But when you bring up another solution that is equally authoritarian but has way more benefits than harm (vasectomy mandates for men), pro-lifers are suddenly not okay with that at all because \u201chis body, his choice\u201d. I don\u2019t see how anyone can look at that as anything other than sexist, misogynistic, and ultimately extremely patriarchal. ALL of the onus of pregnancy and childbirth, including all of the contraception, is placed onto women. The only people who are forced to share their internal organs with another human being against their will, are women. The only people who are expected to sacrifice their own health and lives for another person to grow inside of them against their will, are women. \nAnd let\u2019s not forget how horribly pregnant women are treated by society. Especially single, pregnant women. No paid maternity leave, discrimination as a pregnant woman, no financial protections put in place for pregnant women. The average cost for pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care is $18,865, with an average out-of-pocket cost of $2,854. And that\u2019s WITH INSURANCE! \n\nNot to mention the culture surrounding pregnant women here. In other countries, like Japan for example, people MOVE out of the way for pregnant women. You\u2019re standing in a long line at the bank? A pregnant woman gets to cut to the front of the line so she doesn\u2019t have to wait. You\u2019re on the bus and it\u2019s full? You give up your seat for a pregnant woman. Long line at the bathroom and a pregnant woman comes along? You know the drill. \n\nBut in the US? Society says \u201cfuck you\u201d to pregnant women and that\u2019s about as much compassion as they get. If that doesn\u2019t spell \u201cpatriarchy\u201d to you then I don\u2019t know what does.\n\nAnd I haven\u2019t even gotten to all the men who want rape victims, including children, to be forced to give birth against their will. \n\nThis country is *disgustingly* patriarchal.",

No. But are there white people in America today who do still view black people as inferior? Yes, absolutely. And white America just voted one of those racist white people into office as the president for a *second term*. \n\nDonald Trump is a known racist against black people. His own people who\u2019ve worked with him in the past confirmed his racist attitudes and remarks towards black people, calling them lazy as a race. Or what about how he spouted racist lies and conspiracy theories on love TV against shariah immigrants, saying \u201cthey\u2019re eating people\u2019s pets,\u201d comparing these people to animals? And let\u2019s not forget his racist practices with his real estate business where he actually faced legal consequences because he wouldn\u2019t rent to black people and wouldn\u2019t hire black people as employees, purposefully, because they were black. That\u2019s blatant racism, and apparently the majority of America (namely WHITE Americans) are totally okay with that. They\u2019d actually rather have the racist white supremacist, convicted rapist, criminal felon as our president than the more-than-qualified black/Indian woman who doesn\u2019t have so much as an infraction on her legal record\u2014let alone a history of racism and sexism.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019d say this country is also white supremacist as a whole based on their choice for president alone. In addition to being sexist and patriarchal. We haven\u2019t even once had a female president. And we\u2019ve only ever had ONE non-white president! The only reason the country as a whole wouldn\u2019t be white supremacist is because liberals vote too. The vast majority of conservatives however want white people to continue being at the top, they\u2019ve made that pretty clear politically.",

    "text": "I work in multimedia, and the number of big tech corps that do nothing except buy up software companies then use their weight to impose predatory and unethical business practices is getting bad. Long established companies have shifted to this model as well, top of the list being Adobe.\n\nHere's a few examples:\n\nLast year Adobe blocked all access to Creative Suite 4 and below. At the time Adobe ran an own-what-you-buy business model before shifting over to subscription with creative cloud, the successor to Creative Suite. That means in 2008 if you spent $2500 on CS4, you're SOL. The software you bought and paid for will not connect to Adobe servers and you will be prevented from running it. All because \"Terms subject to change\".  \nIf you have a pirated version it works just fine.\n\nSpeaking of TOS. 6 months ago Adobe updated their terms, stating that they reserve the right to both automatically (bots) and manually (an actual human being) rummage through your projects in order to train their AI and \"improve their product\". The kicker? For people who already had the software installed they had to accept the TOS. They offered no option to decline. Only way to decline was to hard shut down your PC and then uninstall. Opting out means not being able to use the software you're paying for. Or you can pirate it and keep Adobe's grubby little fingers out of your stuff. Imagine someone from your grocery store just walks into your house and starts rummaging through your fridge. If you complain, they just show you a piece of paper saying if you buy from them they reserve the right to go through your fridge and cupboard. If you disagree then you're not allowed to do your groceries there.\n\nMillions of people use Adobe products and have built their entire careers around mastering their software. Suddenly, if they want to continue using it, they have no choice but to allow adobe access to all of their content. This includes client work that may be under NDA. It's easy to say \"just use different software\", but for some studios this comes with a host of complications, such as training staff to use new solutions. Then there's completely changing a production pipeline that has been in place for years. It's expensive and time consuming, and negatively affects the reputation you have with your clients since you're unable to meet their demands at the same speed they're used to.\n\nAutodesk entered the scoop-em-up model about 20 years ago with the acquisition of Alias Maya. Since then they've scooped up dozens of software under their umbrella and provide the same predatory subscription service and privacy infringements as Adobe. Trials have limited features and are 15 days. There isn't a single person who will be able to learn and judge a DCC app in 15 days. These things are extremely complex, and most people only stick to their discipline. You can be an exceptional animator but have zero ability to Model. Or vice versa.   \nOn the opposite side of the business model, SideFX, the creators of Houdini, offer a fully featured unlimited Trial version of their software. The only limitations are a small render size of 1920x1080 (with a watermark) and the inability to export your scenes into other software. If you want to take 5 years to familiarize yourself with the software you can do so without pirating. For those that don't know Houdini is the industry leader for special effects like destruction, smoke and fire simulation and fluid dynamics. It makes sense for a trial version to restrict your ability to export your creations for rendering elsewhere. SideFX also offers an indie license for $200/year for budding studios making less than 100k/year. Their regular perpetual license in comparison is $7000 + the cost of version upgrades. And it's worth every penny.\n\nYears ago when piracy in film and television was at it's peak, it was a direct response to the price gouging from producers and cable companies, who were in cahoots to make watching your favorite content as expensive as television. Big into sports? Get the sports Network for an extra 20$/month. You can watch football and Baseball there, but if you liked Hockey too, well it was another $20 because that channel was in a different package. Hollywood started freaking out and got ICE! involved. They tried really hard to crack down on piracy. I knew people who ran an illegal streaming site. They went to jail for 5 years! for pirating TV. A rapist is unlucky if they get more than 6 months. Despite all that, streaming sites kept popping up like whack-a-mole. Then suddenly enterprising new business models came in. 8$/month for a streaming service. Watch all the content they had available. Piracy dropped drastically overnight. People don't want to be thieves. They want to practice ethical business with the companies that offer services. But people WILL find alternatives when businesses start to enact predatory behavior.\n\nPiracy is the only tool that consumers of digital content have to hold the companies they do business with accountable for unethical practices and price gouging. Without piracy digital content would be extremely expensive. Change my View.",

I'm comfortable with a Honda, and the price point for leasing a Honda has so far been ok with me. During my last service, however, Honda installed cameras in my car which I'm not allowed to remove otherwise my car won't start. They also increased my lease to that  of a Bentley.

It was always either about profiting off of others work or feeling entitled to something that you're either too broke or cheap to spend money on.\n\nAnd it's interesting that you use enterprise level professional software as an example. You say a client would be unsatisfied that you can't work as efficiently with an alternative software, so that's a justification to pirate it?\n\nWell, what happens if you get busted? The company that hired you is going to be just as liable as you are, and it's no longer just you using the software privately, and you're dragging any potential clients into legal liability because of your work produced via unauthorized or unlicensed software, so you're directly putting them in harm's way and they're going to have to deal with that fallout.\n\nIt's no different than copying someone else's patent and selling it at a lower cost, and the only reason your cost is lower is because you didn't go through the proper channels and created unfair competition, or copying someone's art to use in your own, or plagiarism.",

I don't deny there are so many different aspects of life and society that have seen improved due to the technological era we reside in, and the increased industrial emphasis on research and science which brings these advancements.\n\n I see that there are these tangible quality of life improvements, but I question whether our lives and well-being are truly higher than our most recent ancestors, for most, not all humans.\n\nI definitely posit there are exceptions like China which saw over the 21st century an incredible amount of growth, but even there I'd say if you looked at the actual metrics right now, it's clear that many, especially younger Chinese, don't feel as well off as a few generations back did. \n\nIn a university course, I learned that every American generation from Gen X on has become progresively more and more and more worse off, tangibly due to the higher and higher costs to buy a home, or to afford what's considered necessary in common American life for a comfortable and decent quality of life living, such as a car, consistent and healthy food, housing, ideally owned.\n\nNow yes, countries with better social nets have absorbed these impacts for their working and lower middle class populations much better, but as a European American I know all too well from extended family as well as my brother who resides in Germany that it is has become more and more expensive to live.\n\nNot that everything is about the economy, but it appears even societal institutions all over are crumbling or beginning to, with increased distrust and disillusionment in everything, from the presst to governance. Does it feel like we as a species choose to ignore all of these flashing warning signs so that our day to day existence doesn't fall apart, but aren't we, as a global society, starting to fall apart? Or am I missing some better angle, bigger picture here?",

Cancer survival rates have doubled since the 1970s. Your ancestors would've killed for our \"worse off\" living standards.\n\nYou mention \"societal institutions crumbling\" but forget that previous generations lived through ACTUAL crumbling - world wars, Spanish flu, polio epidemics. We're just more aware of problems because of 24/7 news and social media.\n\nSure, we face challenges. But saying we're suffering more than our ancestors? That's objectively false.

You teach someone how to type, how to navigate the web, how to use MS Powerpoint and play minesweeper, that's all cool. I'm pretty well versed today - I'm 24, I used to sneak onto my Grandma's PC to look at eBaum's World and YTNND back when I was in the first grade.\n\nBut then I'd go run around outside, get a hula hoop and chase it with a stick, tease my cousins. I had a Radio Flyer, all that shit. Never in my life did I consider the possibility of doing anything outside with a screen except for those people in cafes and trains messing around on those high tech laptop computers. I think in the third grade, I got one of those crazy open-faced dial phones on my Dad's Cingular plan. I was fine with that for all my teen years; I collected CDs for portable music (Rasputin's) and used burner phones to sell acid until I was 19. Then, my brother gave me a smartphone so I could function better as an adult in the modern world.\n\nI see myself this way: sure, my early years were a time where it was easy to get away with not having mobile devices and tablets, but I also went through the period where kids apparently *must* have them and came out perfectly fine. I had a PC at home (neat!), I had my flips and burners, I had friends on the corner, I had my art, I even had mobile gaming consoles (which I didn't even play much). I had everything to do and more. I was hardly ever bored. I laughed for four hours at infomercials once. I rarely thought of having a phone.\n\nSo why not just let kids go without them? Especially at the really young ages when they can do so much more that adults can't do, like play at parks and do street hockey. It just feels a bit ridiculous that a phone should be more than a 'call mom' type thing. If they still made beepers, I'd even opt for that instead. And now I see all this shit about it 'impairing motor function' - before the age of six? Are you kidding me? We don't even have proper adults who have come from the birth year brackets discussed in this controversy.\n\nJust seems like a recipe for disaster.",

While technology has made life more convenient, I believe we are unknowingly sacrificing real-world experiences and human connection in the process.\n\nFor example, buying groceries or clothes used to be a social activity. People would go out with family or friends, physically check items, try things on, and ask for opinions. Now, most just read reviews and make a purchase without any real interaction. Even something as personal as choosing furniture. where you\u2019d once discuss designs and needs with someone\u2026is now just a matter of scrolling through online ratings.\n\nEducation is another example. Traditional classrooms with face-to-face discussions are fading as online classes become more dominant. While this makes learning more accessible, I feel it removes depth and engagement.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there:\n1. Dating & Relationships \u2013 Instead of meeting naturally, dating apps have turned human connection into a swipe-based algorithm.\n\n2. Healthcare \u2013 Many people self-diagnose with Google instead of seeing a doctor, leading to unnecessary anxiety or misinformation.\n\n3. Conversations & Social Interactions \u2013 People prefer texting over talking, voice notes over real-time discussions, and AI-generated responses over organic conversations.\n\n4. Knowledge Sharing \u2013 Instead of mentorship or personal discussions, people turn to YouTube and AI for answers, reducing direct human learning.\n\nI\u2019m not saying technology is bad\u2026it obviously makes life easier. But are we losing something valuable along the way? It feels like convenience is replacing meaningful interactions, and we\u2019re becoming more disconnected from real experiences.\n\nCMV: Is this shift just the natural evolution of society, or are we unknowingly isolating ourselves?\n",

It might go up more in the future but for now it hasn't really changed.\n\nAlso his approval hasn't really changed much since he took office. Maybe a few points depending on the poll but nothing significant.

Passports should not cost that much.\n\nThe cost of printing a $10 bill is around 0.06 cents. Money notes are tamper proof and durable so same idea could apply for a passport.\n\nA passport has around 32 pages, so that's $1.92. Let's assume than the biograph page cost $1 because it includes the photo, customized data and the biometric NFC chip. Add another $0.25 for the \"book covers\".\n\nSo the objetive price should be $3.17. Let's make it $10 to take into account the distribution cost, the centralised database and the software.\n\nThat's it.",

Where are you getting a huge overhaul and change in the infrastructure of passports in a country like the U.S. would not cost that much?\u00a0\n\nThere are 25 million of passports issued in US every year. A machine could attend 4 person per hour, which makes 48 persons per day (assuming it's not available in the night). That makes 17,520. Let's round that number down to 15,000.\n\nSo you need: 25 million / 15,000 = 1,666 machines. Let's round up to 2000 machines.\n\nWhat's the cost of a machine? It's a fancy photo machine with a passport printer (which it's a fancy printer basically).\n\nIn theory you could recreate a similar system with $2,000-$3,000 per machine. But let's assume $100,000 instead.\n\nSo the cost would be 20 million dollars of capital investment. If we include installation cost and distribution, that would go up to 100 million dollars.... Yeah, I'm increasing the costs in an unrational way. It should not cost that much, but let's continue with the example.\n\nSo you could charge an extra 2$ per passport and you would recover the investment in 2 years (and then keep the charge just for machines maintenance).",

Those automated border gates are for people who have passports and often additional documents.\n\nYeah, but they solve the same problem: \"verify that you really are who you say you are\".\n\n>  \nThey certainly do. You apply for a passport, government workers have to check multiple databases. Computers can help, but the humans have to maintain those databases, interpret the information from the databases, enter the information into those databases in the first place, etc\n\nI don't know US. But in Spain, the appointment doesn't take more than 10 minutes and you receive the passport immediately.\n\nAt least in Spain, the only reason to refuse a passport is because a court said so (for example, because you are in criminal proceedings). Computer can check all of that in seconds and present that information with a yes/no response.",

They are a special case and it's reasonable for them to charge an extra fee on top.\n\nFor passports within the country, you have $6.83 to finance the distribution and the processing fees. You have plenty of ways to do that in an efficient way:\n\n\\- For example, you could do online-only and deliver the passports by post (that's how it works in UK). Most of the passports applications would be processed by the software, automatically printed and shipped. In that case, 6 USD is more than enough.\n\n\\- Another alternative is to keep your passport offices but automate the process. You could go to a machine, give your old passport number and your biometrics (your fingerprints or face recognition). The machine would take a photo from you and print the passport on the spot. Very edge cases (for example, people with dissabilities or where machine is not able to recognize) could be scalated to a human worker there.",

There is simply no profit possible in keeping a large stockpile of vaccines, medications, and other emergency anti-biohazard materials just in case of an outbreak or a biological attack, so it has to be the government. The whole point of it is a \"just in case\" where we expect the vast majority of medicines stockpiled eventually expire unused. \n\nIt drives me crazy when I hear the \"private companies can do it better\" because we only ever compare the absolute best private companies that have already beat out the competition. The vast majority of private firms fail within a few years. If we had chosen a chemical company to take over all chemical production for America in 1960, we would have chosen Dupont. Good thing we didn't, because Dupont is now the 25th largest chemical producer by revenue and it's a shell of its former self.",

It looks like Australia is issuing around 2.5M passports a year. So at $400 a pop, that\u2019s $1B. \n\nI take back my comment. It seems Australia is using passports as a revenue source. That being said, $10 is still crazy and unrealistic and so is $400.",

That's quite literally what you are doing. You are selling your body and your time to your employer. In many cases this means treating yourself like an object - or a cog in a machine. Your job might be to move boxes from A to B, run a wire from a room to another, or mix up ingredients into a dough. In most jobs, your individuality doesn't matter. Your ability to perform a defined task is what matters.\n\nSelf employment is empowering because it involves selling your body *for yourself*. You're not a cog in someone else's machine, working to make them a profit, and financially beholden to their whims. You are your own machine, making yourself profits, and financially beholden to no one but yourself. Sex work is *generally* an endeavor in self employment. \n\n\u2022 An independent prostitute chooses who they have sex with. They choose how much to charge for their time. They set the rules for the encounter. \n\n\u2022 An OnlyFans model chooses what content to produce. They choose how much to charge for access. They set the rules for their community and can control who interacts with their platform. \n\nMost people, in most jobs, aren't as empowered as these people are. They do what they're told, they get paid whatever the boss is willing to pay, and they're forced to work under the rules established by someone else or they will lose their income.",

What you\u2019re thinking of is a *very* small percentage of sex workers.\n\nI support sex workers themselves, but realistically it not a great industry. There is a lot of interesting media about it.",

        "text": "> people will say it\u2019s empowering, especially for women, but i can\u2019t ever see how selling yourself and treating yourself as an object is empowering.\n\nI think you misunderstand the position being expressed. Usually when women say something like OnlyFans is empowering it is because within the context of doing sex work a platform like OnlyFans is empowering compared to other venues. If they were strippers they might be expected to go to some smoky club, following rules and dealing with coworkers they don't necessarily like. They would have little control over the clientele and keep a schedule they may dislike.\n\nIn contrast an OF worker can work from the comfort and security of their home. They can pick their hours, decide what clients and requests they serve, and generally do sex work their way. That is empowering!\n\nBeyond that comparative empowerment the ability to do sex work is somewhat empowering when you consider that it isn't legal everywhere. A woman might have a service that is in high demand and that they are willing to sell, yet they are prevented doing so by law despite nobody being harmed. Allowing that woman to sell that service and greatly increase her income is empowering, even if you don't find it \"respectable work\".\n\n> i care about women, i care about our rights, and i care about our dignity. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s empowering to make it known that you think it\u2019s okay for men to purchase women.\n\nSex work isn't slavery, a client doesn't *own*  a sex worker. It is a service akin to a haircut or musical performance. If it is OK to pay for someone to play a guitar for our entertainment then why not to dance around naked?\n\nIf you care about women's rights then surely you would agree that women should be allowed to sell sexual services if they want to. Their ability to choose is protecting their rights!\n\n> you\u2019re still treating yourself as something that can be purchased regardless of your gender.\n\nEveryone's services can be purchased, or do you not work? If a man goes and works 8 hours at the local mill or 8 hours sucking dick, neither means the purchaser *owns them*.\n\nI think you need to examine why you are treating sex as if it is laying a claim of ownership on the person as opposed to just an activity. Most likely this comes from the traditional view of women essentially becoming the property of their husband, signified by them having sex on their wedding night.\n\nIt was even traditional in some places to display a bedsheet with some blood on it to show that the sex had occurred and that the woman was previously a virgin (hence the blood from the torn hymen). In turn due to the inaccuracy of the hymen existing and tearing it became practice for older women to strategically cut a newly married woman's genitals so that she would bleed and preserve her reputation as the sheet was displayed.\n\nYou see how sexist and barbaric such practices appear today? And yet you are continuing those same traditions by assuming that sex implies ownership over one's partner.\n\n> a lot of people who get into porn are usually very young, as in freshly 18 or sometimes under 18. a lot of them are being trafficked.\n\nAbuse is abuse no matter the trade. A sex worker who is trafficked is just as exploited as an agricultural worker who is trafficked. There is nothing about the sex work itself that implies trafficking though.",

I dont see how a person can be a feminist who advocates for abortion on the grounds of bodily autonomy but then shame or judge people for participating in porn or prostitution.\n\n>\u00a0prostitution is usually an option for those who feel like they\u2019re out of options or they\u2019re also being trafficked. what is empowering about this?\n\nCouldnt we say something similar about abortion?  That it is usually done by women who have no other options because their health/financial situation would make having a kid dangerous or difficult for them?  But this of course is not a valid argument against abortion (at least in my opinion) since although there may be an ideal world where these issues dont exist, where fewer abortions would take place, *we do not live in that world*.  I think you can say a similar thing about sex work.  Would fewer women do it if we lived in a perfect would?  Probably, but that argument is a non starter.\n\nMy second argument is that it is almost impossible to be anti-sex work without being anti-sexworker.  The problem I see with a lot of feminist discourse around the issue is that they portray most sexworkers as poor victims of circumstance, or as being trafficked.  The truth is that for many people (I am tempted to say most, but dont have any stats to back me up) sex work is a choice they make freely.  I have known people who have done sex work in the past - it wasnt because they were forced to, or because it was there only option.  They did it because they wanted to.  Either the pay was better, the hours were better or (gasp!) because they enjoyed it more.  A lot of feminists dont understand this, because they are so bought into the narrative that all sex workers are trafficked, drug addicts, poor, or abused, so what are they to make of these women?  Sadly, I have heard some of the anti-sexwork feminists argue that women who choose to do sex work are theirfore mentally ill or \"gender traitors\" because nobody else would choose such a path.  This may sound extreme, but I would argue it is the natural result of the anti-sex ideology promoted by some feminists.",

Why do you associate those two ideas with sex work? Why is it objectifying? I don't think it is. Sex and attraction is a very normal part of being a human, I don't think it degrades us to participate in those acts regardless of how we do them. \"Selling yourself\" has always been a strange phrase, what does it mean? Selling your body in exchange for compensation? That's all work done for money, not just sex work, but most people wouldn't agree all work is inherently negative. \n\nWhat should matter is consent, has the person been coerced into doing the type of work they do? If the person performing the work isn't enthusiastically consenting to doing the work, then it's a problem, but it still wouldn't be a reason to not respect the individual. That would be tantamount to victim blaming. To get ahead of it, I think you'll need a stronger argument for coercion than just, \"getting paid money to do something in a society where you need money is coercive\" because that is again, all work in capitalism.\n\nAnd under any arguments I'd heavily question your value system that leads you to respect or not respect others purely based on the type of work they do.",

People who have sexual contact with them have to adhere to their boundaries.\n\nAnother fairly common example is someone like Heather Harmon, who only did \"sex work\" with her boyfriend/fiance/husband, selling videos that showed off (1) she bagged a hung guy and (2) you should be jealous at how good the erotic dynamic of their relationship was.\n\nAn actress who is wildly praised for the authenticity and beauty they brought to a love scene - is that sex work?\n\nWhen confronted with people like this, are you contending that they're not actually feeling empowerment, or that the fact that they feel empowerment requires delusional thinking? If the latter, why can't people feel empowered when others find them beautiful, or creatively erotic? \n\nI certainly feel much more empowered when I believe other people think I'm sexy - I find it easy to believe it could be even more empowering if I knew it for a fact, because people literally paid to watch me have sex with my spouse.",

You have complete creative control. And you get all the money from it (minus costs such as equipment, hosting costs). None of these are true with employed work.

That\u2019s still pretty inarguably sex work by your definition.\n\nNow how about IG models who never are nude\u2026but prance around in the tiniest bikinis showing off their bodies and profiting off of people sexualizing them? Is that still adult entertainment? That\u2019s now already in your grey zone. They treat themselves as a sexual object and sell it.\n\nNow one step off from that is any professional models. They\u2019re ABSOLUTELY selling their body, literally being treated as a prop to sell whatever they\u2019re dressed in/standing on etc. Still, inarguably selling themselves as an object for cold hard cash\u2026sometimes a sexualized one\u2026sometimes minimally sexualized.\n\nNow, what about an actor? Sure they need some skills\u2026but they also need looks at least as importantly. And some folks consider them little more than \u201ctalking props,\u201d in the industry. (Tongue in cheek generally, but still).\n\nNow what about a body builder?\n\nAn athlete?\n\nSure these folks train and also show skill that you could argue is what they\u2019re really selling\u2026but that argument would be poor for a few reasons (1) the skill is important\u2026but so is the body. Micheal Phelps is a great example. Absolutely a well trained swimmer with brilliant hard earned skills\u2026but also had a number of physical and physiological quirks to his body that made him wonderfully designed to be a swimmer. (2) Saying that skill counts for them\u2026but not for sex workers leads nicely into where I\u2019m going next\u2026.\n\nIf you say the difference between all these things is the \u201cskill,\u201d or \u201csex,\u201d tells me that your problem isn\u2019t high minded or ideological\u2026.its antisex from your own biases. You may believe that there\u2019s no skill involved\u2026you may also believe that just inherently by making their work ABOUT sex (instead of sexualized\u2026like a model) they suddenly are no longer worthy of your respect.\n\nNow, that\u2019s all fine if that\u2019s your opinion\u2026but don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re doing anything than judging others based on a regressive moral code that was originally designed to repress and control people (particularly women).\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say the sex work INDUSTRY is empowering, it\u2019s got huge amounts of exploitation\u2026and it isn\u2019t to say many sex workers don\u2019t end up exploited by their customers even if they are independent. But for you to say that you \u201cdon\u2019t respect them,\u201d shows your true colors.",

        "text": "Even though I disagree with your view, let me say up front that your view is valid.  It's just your way of looking at it.  Of course I honestly feel like it'd be healthier for you to change your view, but even so it doesn't mean that your view is invalid and I can see where it's coming from, to an extent.\n\nWhat is \"empowering\" is subjective, of course.  There are reasons to see sex work as empowering and reasons to see it as the opposite, and of course it depends on how you view the idea of sex work.  I will say that there is an important factor going into that empowerment that you aren't touching upon, and that is the distinction between a sex worker working for themselves, and working for someone else (i.e. a pimp.)  I think very few people would try to claim that working for a pimp is \"empowering,\" for obvious reasons.  Whereas sex work that is not under anyone's control at the very least is empowering in the sense that you can run it as your own business, without having to worry about violence or extortion.  Just being free of those concerns, I think it's fair to say is very empowering compared to how sex work has been for much of the time historically.\n\nLet's talk about this \"treating yourself as something that can be purchased,\" in a sense that's true for any kind of work, is it not?  Whether you're doing back breaking physical work, or even working in a cubicle or whatever you're doing, in some sense you are selling your labor as a commodity.  But for some reason that's okay with you, and specifically work of a sexual nature is not.  Why is that, really?  I would hazard to guess that it's because of the way we treat sex in society, as something that is \"special\" and needs to be put on some sort of pedastal, treating our bodies as some sort of sacred object.  Personally I don't think this is a healthy view of sexuality, and this view that our bodies are sacred objects is actually a product of archaic religious thinking, backed up by emotional thinking that doesn't actually fit the rational world.  The reality is that your body is not a sacred object.  It's just merely an object, and as long as you're using it in a way you see fit, I don't think anyone should see it as a problem.  Therefore, I don't see sex work as anything particularly worse than any other type of work.  Some may find it empowering and some may not enjoy it, and either viewpoint is valid.",

There is no job that you aren't selling yourself or treating yourself like an object. A construction worker is selling their body and treating their body like an object. When people say it's empowering they mean it in a capitalist society. A construction worker can be empowering by building something for society members. There is nothing truly empowering in a capitalist society but that construction worker and sex worker can both be empowered to help the people they choose to.\n\n\n>\u00a0care about women, i care about our rights, and i care about our dignity. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s empowering to make it known that you think it\u2019s okay for men to purchase women.\n\n\nMen or women aren't purchasing these women or men, they purchasing their time and service. Just line any other capitalist job. Would you feel the same way about a rich woman hiring a man to haul stuff for labor?? Both can be physically exploitive work.\u00a0\n\n\n>won\u2019t ever bash a sex worker because i don\u2019t know their circumstance, but i don\u2019t respect them\n\n\nYou just did bash them all in one sentence. This sounds like pure privilege.\n\n\n>a lot of people who get into porn are usually very young, as in freshly 18 or sometimes under 18. a lot of them are being trafficked. prostitution is usually an option for those who feel like they\u2019re out of options or they\u2019re also being trafficked. what is empowering about this?\n\n\nThis is the dark side of unregulated or not regulated enough sex work. This isn't the fault of sex work but if the laws of society to protect them. If you look at the construction industry there is multiple government agencies whose whole purpose is to protect them. If there was no OSHA or labor board and construction workers were dying unnecessarily every day, would you be upset at the construction worker or the fact that the government and society let them down?? It's the same issue when it comes to sex work, the government and society is allowing sex workers to be exploited. It's not the fault of sex work or sex workers, it's the fault of the government and society that isn't helping them.",

If you choose to spend time with someone with those values, it says to me that one of two things must be true.  Either you also support those values and see no issue with spending time with a person like that, or that you believe having \"a good personality\" is more important (which in turn tells me you are privileged enough not to have real skin in the game because *you* won't be the person not allowed to get married or not allowed to vote).\n\nIn your extreme example of spending time with a rapist because they have a good personality, that tells me that it's more important to you that you enjoy you fun hangout than it is to send a message that rape is bad.  You could shun the rapist and thereby express that you don't agree with rape, but if that person is fun to be around, you won't.  You've made a choice about what is more important.  You've shown us what you value.  And what is more important when choosing who we spend time with than what someone values?

But y tho?\n\nA lot of people who don't feel too deeply about social issues or politics may not understand peoples distaste for associating with certain people. It communicates that you don't have a problem with this transgressive thing that this person did. People literally beef about politics because it communicates values.

Well the full story is that they were high and drunk, speeding and crashed into a wall and tree which caused the car to burst into flames. \n\nAnother one was of a professor who was deported after returning from a trip. The story was that despite having a valid visa she was simply deported, no reason given. But they decided to leave out the part where she was found to have attend a terrorist leaders funeral. \n\nThese people either don\u2019t seem to believe the info matters or feel justified in not being straight forward with it because it supports their narrative.

It was involved in a high speed crash which damaged the vehicle including the doors as happens in many cases which is why firefighters have a special tool just for that.

It\u2019s completely valid to question Tesla\u2019s safety features and the ability of emergency responders to access a locked vehicle \u2014 especially because those are institutional responsibilities.

Her attending a funeral might feel relevant to you, morally \u2014 but if the courts ruled that wasn\u2019t grounds for deportation, then what matters is that a legal system was ignored. Again, this is about power and systems, not just individual actions.\n\nIf your point is that public opinion should always include moral background on every person being harmed by a system, that\u2019s a values stance \u2014 not a fact-checking standard. News outlets have reported on all of these details. What you\u2019re frustrated by is the narrative focus \u2014 which doesn\u2019t make it misinformation.

It seems like the story is that Tesla has gone out of its way to eliminate pretty obvious safety feature in the Cybertruck.

    "text": "I think that the parliamentary systems in those countries are among the most ideal forms of government, with Canada and the UK being my favorite examples.\n\nWhat I mean by that is systems where districts are drawn nationally dividing the country into districts of roughly equal population, holding elections for the seats, and picking a PM/leader based on who won the most seats, or a coalition if 0 parties are in the majority. \n\nEssentially, the reason I'm a huge fan of it is that I think it's a good hard check on tyranny of the minority, whilst also giving room for minority parties to have their voices heard, particularly when no party has won a majority in elections. And also, the fact that over time, any incumbent party could lose easily and lose *hard*. \n\nAlso, even with that hard check on minority rule, you still need to win enough regions at the end of the day. So, it's the perfect compromise between full scale majority rule and outright tyranny of the minority. \n\nNow, I do think there are some inaccuracies in the system and how representative it is, particularly given the first past the post system, which states that for an individual seat, someone who gets a plurality automatically wins even if it was a multi party race and the winner got like 30% of the votes. And yes, that is a downside imo, but that is outweighed by the immense positives of the system. \n\nOne such positive is the fact that many of these nations have a wide array of possible results over time. It's often not that there are a few swing districts with everyone else being rigid. But rather, there are indeed a few truly 50/50 districts, but, in cases of extreme dissatisfaction or satisfaction with the incumbents. \n\nFor instance, before the last election, Conservative Party in England in 2019 had 365/650 seats. Now, they have under 150. Likewise, the Labour Party has suffered catastrophically massive losses of seats in the past as well. The fact this back and forth is possible on such an extreme scale is a testament to a healthy system imo. \n\nAlso, some people will label the whole coalition thing that happens when no party gets a majority as a downside, because they see minority parties as having way too much power there. But I'll say the counter to that is the party with the plurality should have to get a majority of seats for full control. If they don't, it's fair that they should need to compromise and make a coalition. \n",

This is because Wyoming basically is getting a participation trophy.\n\nIt would have fewer citizens per electoral vote than California because each electoral vote from California has to cover more citizens than there are people in Wyoming. If you look at states with 4 electoral votes (so just more than a participation trophy) the difference is reduced to less than 10,000 people difference per electoral college vote.\n\nIf I was to make any changes in the name of making it more fair I would have each congressional district get one vote and each state get 2. So a candidate can win the district and get a consolation vote then the person who sways the state as a whole gets an extra 2 votes.",

The reform party got most of there votes from former conservatives who were not happy with how the conservatives had governed there was a distinct lack of policy or campaigning with the reform vote basically just splitting the right wing vote with the conservatives in most county\u2019s allowing usually runner up party\u2019s in those counties like the Lib Dem\u2019s and Labour to win. It was a part split that caused the odd votes not an unfair system",

    "text": "...They just don't realize it, based on how it's phrased.\n\nCarl von Clausewitz once said \"War is the continuation of politics by other means.\", and from observing history, that pretty much holds true; Just about every war I can think of has been fought to accomplish some sort of political objective, be it conquest or liberation, reclamation or annexation, prestige or humiliation... That's, definitionally, political violence.\n\nThere's been a lot of people clamoring recently about political violence, claiming that it's wrong on principle, and it's wrong to try and justify it under any circumstances, but what they fail to realize is that, if they support any wars at all, they themselves also support political violence. In the American Civil War, it was through political violence that the Confederacy was kept in the Union, and the slaves were freed. Most people support that, no? Or, if you'll forgive me for going full Godwin, the Allies marched into Germany, and kept it under military occupation for years to dismantle the Nazi regime. That sounds pretty violent, no?\n\nEven if wars were to be arbitrarily excluded from \"political violence\", though, and we were to just limit ourselves to small-scale domestic conflicts, my point still stands. That definition still encompasses the internal German resistance against the Nazis, for instance; There were many attempts made on Hitler's life, and his would-be assassins, like Claus von Stauffenberg, are honored to this day. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who would argue, not only that they don't deserve to be honored, but that the attempt itself wasn't justified, and it wouldn't have been good if it succeeded.\n\nIn essence, I think that if you were to ask a random person on the street \"Is political violence justified?\" and \"Would assassinating Hitler be unjustified?\", you'd probably get a resounding \"No.\" to both questions, but while that's obviously contradictory, I don't think most people are consciously lying about either stance. When they hear \"political violence\", they think of modern incidents of violence in pursuit of modern political goals, and to them, the political causes of today are so... Normal, for lack of a better term, that violence in support of/against one of them doesn't even register as the same as violence for/against one of the historical causes that they've been taught all their lives were good/evil. Not to mention wars, which most people consider a whole other animal, even if, fundamentally, they're political violence, too.\n\nTl;dr: All wars, assassinations, etc, are, objectively, political violence, so if one supports *any* of them, then they're not opposed to political violence on principle, it's just a matter of what circumstances they think it's justified under. Most people who claim to oppose political violence on principle also support at least a few wars, assassinations, etc, throughout history, creating a contradiction, but I don't think it's a deliberate falsehood on their part. Rather, I think that they subconsciously apply modern connotations to the term \"political violence\" to the point where they don't even register the historic examples they support as being the same thing.",

An assassination committed by a nation\u2019s special ops unit against the leader of an aggressor nation with whom we are at war is generally not what we mean by \u201cpolitical violence\u201d. \n\nA private citizen assassinating a leader for political reasons would be political violence. The guy who shot Trump was committing political violence. The Black Panthers bombing a police station is political violence. Etc. \n\nSo, really we\u2019re just having a definitional issue here.",

Resource based warfare can be political but they can also be survival and I'd argue across all of human existence more survival wars have been fought, although these were much smaller scale than modern ones. \n\nAlso, not all assassinations are political. Assassinations of politicians or some prominent figures are but I guess my argument is semantics. Does the assassination of a drug dealer encroaching on territory count as political? I guess from a perspective inter-drug cartel politics are present but most are probably revenge, retribution, or territorial. \n\nAlso, Gandhi is a prime example of a pacifist who has a large following to this day. And there is a difference between political violence and moral violence that also affects politics. Your example of the Holocaust, sure political ramifications occurred but if you asked me if I'm opposed to the Nazi ideology because of politics vs morality or ethics, it's the morality and ethics. I'm morally and ethically opposed, that extends to their political stance. But the violence I'd be willing to commit against Hitler isn't politically motivated, it's morally motivated.",

Political violence on the other hand may be classified as violence employed because the violence will suppress or strengthen a certain political group/idea. \n\nYou may classify point 1 as political violence as well, which would be reasonable, since it involves politics. I would still maintain that it is an important distinction that most Americans support point 1 whether it is political or not, and most Americans do not support point 2. Basically, most Americans support violence against NAZI Germany because of the threat it posed to human life, rather than worries about a strong German state or any policies Germany employed that did not endanger human life. Most Americans would not support a war against a dictatorship that does not threaten human life on a wide scale.\n\nThis is very arguable as I do not have data, this just represents the vast majority of my anecdotal experience. I say Americans because I am American and cannot speak to popular opinion elsewhere, though I would guess this is similar in Western Europe.",

For the American revolution, they had no avenue to enact change because they had no representation in government. They tried but it wasn't working. \n\nYou don't just start with a war. We live in a civilized society. If you want something changed on a large scale, you shouldn't try and get it changed through violence because there are non-violent methods you can use first. Otherwise you have no principles. You end up in a 'might is right' situation which is barbaric.\n\nOr another way to think about it is that most people in the US have some political idea they want changed. It would be absolute chaos if everyone decided they should get what they want through violence. We would not live in a civilized society at that point. It's perfectly reasonable to be against political violence like this and still recognize wars can sometimes be justified. Those aren't contradictory.",

    "text": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how boys are treated growing up, and I\u2019m convinced that from a very young age, boys\u2014of all races\u2014are made to feel like the world doesn\u2019t like them or want them. It starts early, and it\u2019s a systemic problem that\u2019s only getting worse. I believe this sets the stage for a lot of the struggles young men face today, from mental health issues to dating woes, and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on why I might be wrong.\n\nHere\u2019s my case:  \n  \nFrom the moment boys step into school, the environment seems stacked against them. Think about elementary school\u2014most teachers are women (something like 75-80% in the U.S.), and they\u2019re often more attuned to nurturing girls, who tend to be quieter and more compliant. Boys, on the other hand, are naturally more rambunctious\u2014running around, roughhousing, being loud. Instead of channeling that energy, schools often punish it. A boy acting out gets detention or a lecture about \u201cappropriate behavior,\u201d while a girl throwing a tantrum might get a softer \u201clet\u2019s talk about your feelings\u201d approach. Studies have even shown that boys are disciplined more harshly than girls for the same behaviors\u2014check out the 2015 study from the Journal of Pediatric Psychology if you\u2019re curious. Boys are held to a higher standard of self-control, while girls get more leeway.\n\nThen there\u2019s grading. Research\u2014like a 2018 study from the American Economic Association\u2014suggests teachers tend to mark girls higher than boys for similar work, especially in subjective subjects like English or art. Boys have to work harder to prove themselves, while girls get the benefit of the doubt. And opportunities? Girls have mentorship programs, STEM initiatives, scholarships galore\u2014all of which are awesome, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014but where\u2019s the equivalent for boys? The message is clear: girls need support to succeed; boys are just expected to figure it out.\n\nGrowing up, boys are constantly told their natural instincts are wrong. Want to wrestle with your friends? That\u2019s \u201ctoo aggressive.\u201d Like competition? You\u2019re \u201ctoxic.\u201d Even their curiosity gets shut down\u2014think of how many times a boy\u2019s \u201cdisruptive\u201d questions in class get him labeled a troublemaker, while a girl\u2019s shyness is coddled. It\u2019s like society\u2019s saying, \u201cBe less you.\u201d\n\nFast forward to today: these boys become young men, and the world doesn\u2019t get any kinder. Take dating\u2014Gen Z guys are struggling hard. A 2023 survey (I think it was from the American Psychological Association) found that a huge chunk of guys under 25 haven\u2019t been on a date or even kissed anyone in the last year. Meanwhile, girls are thriving\u2014social media, dating apps, and cultural shifts have put them in the driver\u2019s seat. Rejection stings, sure, but it\u2019s worse when you\u2019re already conditioned to feel like the world\u2019s against you. Then you see girls\u2014who, let\u2019s be real, aren\u2019t always supermodels\u2014living life on \u201ceasy mode,\u201d getting attention and validation effortlessly. It\u2019s maddening.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about dating, though. It\u2019s the cumulative effect. Boys grow up feeling like they\u2019re the enemy\u2014too loud, too aggressive, too *male*\u2014and then they hit adulthood and get rejected romantically, socially, and professionally. No wonder so many young men are depressed, introverted, or angry. The system\u2019s been telling them they\u2019re disposable since they were kids.\n\nI\u2019m not saying girls have it perfect\u2014everyone\u2019s got struggles\u2014but I think boys are uniquely set up to feel hated, and it\u2019s creating a crisis we\u2019re not addressing. Change my view\u2014tell me where I\u2019m off base or what I\u2019m missing!\n\nI'm an older (31M) who has a lot going for him. I'm relatively good-looking (I can easily set up 1-2 dates a week) using Apps like Hinge on free mode), I make an ok salary \u00a3100k and I'm quite fit. However, I'm not white or tall (5'9\") and you won't believe how white women will treat me sometimes. Especially when drunk, they are rude, racist and condescending. While, that experience and view isn't what this post is about, I mention it because I'm seeing how many girls are becoming narcissistic and entitled.  ",

        "text": "I'm not going to talk about the dating thing, because I agree. It's insane how people like to deny that young men are struggling to find partners and form relationships with women nowadays.\n\nHowever I severely disagree with the school part. You mention that school punishes boys to harshly and a possible reason being that teachers are overwhelmingly women. However several decades ago, the opposite was true. If you go back far enough teaching was a more ''gender-equal'' field, and if you go back even futher it was a male-dominated field. Were things better for boys then ? Nope, back then corporeal punishment in school was still a thing, things like suspension, grade retention, and permanent expulsion came much more easily.\n\nThe problem with school disciplinary measures is that they aren't law and courts. There is no ''setencing guidelines'' or standard of proof etc. School officials have a autonomy to deal with issues as they come along.\n\n\\> Studies have even shown that boys are disciplined more harshly than girls for the same behaviors\u2014check out the 2015 study from the Journal of Pediatric Psychology if you\u2019re curious\n\nThat doesn't mean that they are targeted or discriminated against. Maybe boys are more likely to be repeat offenders, or commit the ''same'' behaviours under worse circumstances.\n\n\\> they\u2019re often more attuned to nurturing girls, who tend to be quieter and more compliant. Boys, on the other hand, are naturally more rambunctious\u2014running around, roughhousing, being loud.

Allow boys to disrupt classroom activities and the school enviroment to their hearts content ? Teachers and school official have obvious interest in keeping things going orderly, and if boys act out in more actively disruptive ways than girls, it makes sense to treat them more strictly.\n\n\\> And opportunities?

The message is clear: girls need support to succeed; boys are just expected to figure it out\n\nThe reasons programs like that exist it's because women were significantly underreprensented in those fields, and in fact still are in STEM and other top college majors.",

When I read sentences like:\n\n>most teachers are women (something like 75-80% in the U.S.), and they\u2019re often more attuned to nurturing girls, who tend to be quieter and more compliant.\u00a0\n\n>Growing up, boys are constantly told their natural instincts are wrong. Want to wrestle with your friends? That\u2019s \u201ctoo aggressive.\u201d Like competition? You\u2019re \u201ctoxic.\u201d\u00a0\n\n  \nI'm immediately wondering 'really? Based on what exactly?' Why are women teachers automatically more attuned to nurturing girls, when most classes consist of both so they clearly have experience with both? Who are telling these boys that their natural instincs are wrong? Everyone? Where do you base these things on?\n\nThen you go on about how women are now in the 'drivers seat' when dating, but I don't see this as a new thing at all. Women have had more dating choices than men for decades now.\n\nIn reality, how boys and girls are treated depends heavily on where they live in the world, as well as the kind of family and society they grow up in. I believe that a lot of your post is heavily generalized and does not apply at all for all people in the world, or even the west. It mostly feels like this is what you 'feel' is happening, but you really can't draw conclusions about millions of people based on feelings.",

        "text": ">Then there\u2019s grading. Research\u2014like a 2018 study from the American Economic Association\u2014suggests teachers tend to mark girls higher than boys for similar work, especially in subjective subjects like English or art. Boys have to work harder to prove themselves, while girls get the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIt would be nice if you could link these studies or properly cite them with the author's name, date, etc. From what I see, girls do get better grades but the data is not normalized for \"similar answers\". Also, people like Jordan Peterson (whom are thoroughly on the right-wing side of the political spectrum) even admit that boys just exhibit more anti-social, destructive behavior which does contribute to this effect.\n\nSo just like how there are fewer construction worker women because on average, there will be fewer men in the academia as time goes on because that's just how nature is, we just have to take the L on this point.\n\n>fast forward to today: these boys become young men, and the world doesn\u2019t get any kinder. Take dating\u2014Gen Z guys are struggling hard. A 2023 survey (I think it was from the American Psychological Association) found that a huge chunk of guys under 25 haven\u2019t been on a date or even kissed anyone in the last year. Meanwhile, girls are thriving\u2014social media, dating apps, and cultural shifts have put them in the driver\u2019s seat. Rejection stings, sure, but it\u2019s worse when you\u2019re already conditioned to feel like the world\u2019s against you. Then you see girls\u2014who, let\u2019s be real, aren\u2019t always supermodels\u2014living life on \u201ceasy mode,\u201d getting attention and validation effortlessly. It\u2019s maddening.\n\nYou have to realize that this is just on online spaces, there are roughly 1 women for every 1 men, it is literally impossible for \"women\" to thrive and \"men\" to get cucked in the \"sexual market place\".\n\nAlso it is much easier to go out and date people when you don't live paycheck to paycheck. You don't see Elon with his [frog ass body](https://www.threads.net/@thinwhitedude/post/C8lyD_lsiwU) struggle to get girls. He has more kids than the years he's been a legal migrant in the US. \n\nLife would be much easier if instead of blaming each other we pointed our fingers to those who benefit from our suffering.",

        "text": "That is false.  There are many studies showing that for example at very young age male children are given greater attention from their mothers compared to daughters.   This is just the first thing that came to my mind but there are many other such examples.\n\nIn reality the way we approach boys and girls is extremely nuanced and multi-layered with positives and negatives that work a bit like two gears interlocking - which is exactly how you expect a dynamic system capable of sustained evolution to work, and society is one such system.\n\nA  tremendous amount of how children of each sex are treated depends on personality of the parents and adult guardians. And here we arrive at the actual problem.\n\n**Contemporary society has a heavily distorted cultural dissemination system that is historically unprecedented in terms of extreme centralisation**.\n\nIn other words - we live in a society where highly centralised media networks influence our perception of reality and cultural norms to a much greater extent than any other social networks - of family, friends, local community, social customs generated traditionally etc.\n\nAnd this is the crux of the issue: those cultural networks are primarily driven by narcissistic and sociopathic individuals who use them for self-propagation and exploitation of others.\n\nThis means that the women working in the media are focused on self-promotion to the exclusion of other men and men working in the media will be focused on self-promotion to the exclusion of other men.\n\nIs this surprising? Not if you understand how reproductive dynamic works in society i.e. hypergamy both male and female.\n\nFemale hypergamy is about women climbing social hierarchy to attain highest possible status - female reproductive strategy is about quality.\n\nMale hypergamy is about men attempting to gain exclusive access to as many females as possibe - male reproductive strategy is about quantity.\n\nThis inevitably leads to a harem structure with top performing males attracting top performing females.\n\nHow do females become \"top peforming\"? By nepotism if already provileged and by career advancement if not. This is what \"womens rights\" are being used for - to eliminate competition by foul play.\n\nHow do males become \"top performers\" by eliminating their male competition outright.\n\nThese two predatory dynamics converge to produce our contemporary \"man hating\" culture and explain why so many men are on board with \"women's rights\" often in their most toxic form, while at the same time their private lives are filled with sexual misconduct. At the same time this explains why so many women allegedly greatly concerning themselves with \"women's rights\" and sexual misconduct gravitate to said men.\n\nIt's just predatory sociopathic deception.\n\nSo no, society doesn't raise men to be hated and treated as disposable. The predators and parasites in our society do. That's their reproductive strategy.\n\nGet rid of modern media - both traditional and social media - and see the culture shift *overnight* into more traditional healthier more respectful and considerate mindset that is actually representative what normal people think.",

    "text": "When we talk about punctuality and lateness, they said that in different cultures have different perception towards time. They catergorize countries as monochronic and other countries polychronic so neatly. In monochronic countries, they said it\u2019s good to be punctual and bad to be late and in polychronic countries they said it\u2019s good to have relaxed attitude towards time. However in the real world where nuanced complexity exist, all countries have a blend of both meaning they both all have punctuality and lateness at the same time even within countries. People solely rely on cultural differences and ditch cultural similarities (even in real life they have similarities because of globalization and shared human experiences) many times now because they have a black and white thinking disorder in their head the whole time.\u00a0\n\nFor example: If they say it\u2019s good to be punctual and rude to be late in Canada but didn\u2019t mention there are nuances and variations within a country, that implies that there are zero people in Canada who were late and implies that there is clear cut black and white/all or nothing thinking leaving no room for nuances, variations, gray areas and diverse situations within a single country. But, if they say it\u2019s rude to be punctual and good to be late in China for example without mentioning that there is nuances and variations within a country, that implies that there are zero people in China who were punctual that and there is clear clut black and white/all or nothing thinking leaving no room for nuances, variations, gray areas and diverse situations within a single country.\n\nThis stupid oversimplification and stereotype came from this study \u201cEdward T Hall\u2019s Cultural Dimensions\u201d which includes time and it was made by this person who pretends he is smart of cultural study but he\u2019s actually not, Edward T Hall himself. He labels countries as polychronic and other countries monochronic based on his LIMITED personal experiences within these countries and then made up a conclusion in a monolithic view that these people from the cultures that he label as polychronic are late and thinks that being late is absolute bad and the people from other cultures that he label as monochronic are punctual and that being punctual is absolute good without considering the disadvantages.\u00a0\n\nHowever, his cultural dimensions are outdated because this was made in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s and yet today people coming from the internet soley rely on him and his cultural dimension in regards to time and then label it as accurate and view all cultures as monolithic. They propagate and stereotype each other by making posts and articles in many medias, social medias, websites and blogs about cultures that has been called as polychronic as inefficient since they think late is a bad thing and other cultures that has been called as monochronic as the best since they think punctuality is a good thing within all contexts within cultures without mentioning the downsides and worse of all they began circlejerking with each other. Even tourists are involve in this. They want their expectations to be supported based on Edward T Hall\u2019s cultural dimension and everyone else relying on him.\u00a0\n\nEverything ALL STARTED WITH Edward T Hall and his study of cultural dimension of time, he has been reinforcing stereotypes by spreading false narratives and turn it into a dominant narrative and brainwashed people on the internet from the past and today about the countries labeling them as polychronic and other countries monochronic without considering that there are so many nuances, variations and gray areas within all cultures that makes up complexity which will be very hard to measure all cultures in the context of monochronic/punctuality and polychronic/lateness and I\u2019m sorry to say but it\u2019s all Edward T Hall\u2019s fault. He can\u2019t measure all cultures on monochronic/punctuality and polychronic/lateness consistently because all cultures are constantly changing and they\u2019re very diverse, that way we get to see both punctuality and lateness at the same time and it all boils down to different situations even within a same single culture.\n\nLike seriously all cultures are constantly changing all the times and has the mix blend of both which means they have both polychronic/lateness and monochronic/punctuality at the same time within the these cultures.\n\nThe point is, all cultures have both punctuality/monochronic and lateness/polychronic at the same time because they\u2019re influenced by situational factors. So that means within the same cultures, for some situations punctuality is important because it shows that you\u2019re efficient and for other situations being late is ok because it provides flexbility.\u00a0\n\nPlease, try to understand that punctuality and lateness are universal phenomenon and cultural universal and that they both exist at the same time within all cultures because both punctuality and lateness are situational not monolithic even within the same cultures plus all cultures changes all the time and the factors are cultural richness/cultural variations, globalization, cultural hybridization, shared human experiences And situational factors.\n\nThat\u2019s how a person truly and deeply understands cultures by accepting cultural richness/nuances, variations and gray areas within all cultures and not relying on cultural dimensions like Hall and also Hofstede because both of their cultural dimensions are outdated and reinforces stereotypes with no capturing on complexity of the cultures in reality.\n\nEdward T Hall oversimplifies everything, he oversimplified all cultures in the real complex world from complexity into overly simplistic cultural dimensions and then made everyone including the internet and the media believe in him and his cultural dimensions even when it doesn\u2019t reflect all cultures in reality.",

That's not surprising since we watch different news sources. \n\nI've seen clips of people asking about the VA and upset federal workers. Those are not partisan questions, they're things any veteran or federal worker should be worried about. I'm certain that several of them are Republicans, even if they are a small minority. \n\nIt's not a poll. Town halls don't scientifically measure how people are feeling in each party. But if you have a huge turnout, that means a disproportionate number (more than usual) are upset. That's a problem, or it should be seen as a problem, to our representatives.\n\nPeople are losing their jobs and benefits across the spectrum. That's what's upsetting about them refusing to hold town halls and failing to address people's concerns. They clearly only care about votes, not their community, even thousands of innocent people being hurt right now.  Who cares if the people questioning it are majority left leaning? That doesn't mean there's not a problem that representatives need to address, but they aren't showing up.",

Art is a very abstract and complex phenomenon. The only useful definition of it, is to say that every human activity with a technique is an artform. And you need a technique to use the toilet. But the difference between sublime art (painting, music etc) and profane art (memes, farming, going to the toilet) is how it makes you feel. Sublime art gives you an feeling of awe that is lacking in the profane ones.",

I don't think that this is automatically the case as soon as something is expressed as a meme.

I am generally of the opinion that fear of crime in the United States is generally entirely out of proportion to the actual risk, and I suspect that either women's fear of walking in public isn't really justified, or that men actually ought to be a lot more scared (and I think it's the former). Now, I am aware that women in the United States are more likely to be the victim of specifically *sexual* violence than men are (outside of prison at least), but I strongly suspect that the chance of being the victim of violence *perpetrated by a stranger*, per hour spent alone at night, isn't any higher than that of a man. \n\nSome statistics to back me up:\n\nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/violent-crime-strangers-and-nonstrangers-0 was a report in 1987 that said that 70% of all violent crimes commited by strangers were committed against men. [A more recent report in the United Kingdom](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/thenatureofviolentcrimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2024) also concluded that men were significantly more likely to be the victim of violence *perpetrated by a stranger* than women. \n\nIt could still be that women's greater fear of being attacked by a stranger is rational because they suffer worse consequences when they are attacked, but if you look at homicides committed by strangers instead of sexual assaults, I believe that men are far more likely to be murdered by strangers than women are, and I can't imagine that *actually getting killed* would be any less bad than being sexually assaulted and living to tell the tale.

Local news stations have tried having children pretend to act like they're lost and seeing how people react (while being prepared to intervene if something goes wrong) and nobody ever tries to do anything bad to the child actors.

This is the same type of thinking as \"we don't need polio vaccines, barely anyone gets polio anymore\".\n\nThe odds aren't that low either: [https://childsafety.losangelescriminallawyer.pro/missing-and-abducted-children.html](https://childsafety.losangelescriminallawyer.pro/missing-and-abducted-children.html)\n\nAbout 800 000 children are reported missing every year. While a good part of those are by family, too many are by strangers. The majority are resolved within a matter of hours and you don't really hear about those.\n\n>Local news stations have tried having children pretend to act like they're lost and seeing how people react (while being prepared to intervene if something goes wrong) and nobody ever tries to do anything bad to the child actors.\n\nThis is statistically insignificant. The sample size is too small.\n\n>there are enough people in a population of hundreds of millions that it happens to somebody, but it won't happen to you.\n\nEvery person that it does happen to, might have thought the same. Low odds of something happening aren't a good reason to get rid of safety measures.",

From the British study: \n\n> Women were more likely to have experienced violent crime. A higher proportion of women experienced domestic abuse (6.6%), stalking (4.0%), sexual assault (3.4%), and harassment (11.2%) in the last year, compared with men (3.0%, 2.3%, 0.8% and 6.6%, respectively). *However, men accounted for a higher proportion of victims of violence with and without injury where the perpetrator was a stranger (1% of men, compared with 0.4% of women).*\n\nThis is the absolute amount of victimization, it's not adjusted by hours spent alone at night. The reason women are violently victimized by strangers less than men is likely because women are very careful about going out alone at night, i find it hard to believe that if women were as careless as men that the outcomes would be very different. \n\nI mean are we led to believe that violent offenders (who are 99% of the time male) are purposely avoiding attacking women?",

To those concerned, IPV is indeed a form of assault where females are disproportionately victimised, but on a total number of assaults men assault other men most.\n\nConsider the *perception* of crime plays a role in how people feel about being victimized.

But when I switched to manual, I was terrified at first, but soon enough, I felt way more in control and comfortable. My driving improved a lot, and I actually understood the mechanics behind how my car worked\u2014stuff like revolutions per minute (RPM) and engine braking.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though\u2014there are so many people driving around with zero understanding of how their car works. I\u2019ve had conversations with people who don\u2019t even know what a gear is, or what a catalytic converter does. And honestly, I think that\u2019s a problem. Cars are heavy machinery, and if you don\u2019t understand how to use them properly, you\u2019re putting yourself and others at risk.\n\nLiving in Adelaide, I see this on the road a lot. There\u2019s a long, steep descent on the freeway where trucks need to use engine braking to slow down, but I see so many people impatiently tailgating, thinking the truck is going too slow. They don\u2019t understand the truck needs to drive that way to protect its brakes. Instead, they end up speeding, slamming on brakes, and creating a mess, which only makes things more dangerous for everyone.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not against automatic cars, but I think people should have a basic understanding of how a car works before they get behind the wheel. Learning to drive a manual first helps with that. Once you know the fundamentals, automatic becomes a lot easier, and you\u2019re a safer driver in the long run.\n\nAnd please, stop tailgating at red lights on an uphill (you shouldn't tailgate at all TBH). If you\u2019re in a manual, rolling back is normal, and it\u2019s okay. But new manual drivers sometimes struggle with that, and it's dangerous if someone isn\u2019t prepared.",

You don't need to know how the transmission works to get from A to B safely.  You don't need to know the difference between carburetion and fuel injection to know what the gas peddle causes the car to do. \n\nThose people tailgating on the long steep hill aren't doing it because they don't understand how gearing works, or don't understand brake fade and whatnot.  They'd still be tailgating either way because they're just impatient drivers.  Giving them more knowledge about how cars work won't make them less impatient.\n\nYou've contextualized safe driving in a way that makes sense for you, and that's great.  It's also rad that you know how cars work, that's a useful skill as well.  But that's not the only path to safe driving, and we shouldn't exclude people who want to take a different path to get to the same result.",

            "text": "Thanks for asking! I would advise we ban them. They deliver 100% torque instantly and accelerate way too hard, they are all automatic save for some niche models, and for a first-time driver they don't really teach much about the vehicle itself. The vehicle is way too quiet to be safe interacting with bicycles, they are heavier, their batteries end up in landfill for a very long time!\n\nElectric cars do not equal sustainability, their self-driving modules also promote passive driving, and ultimately they try to do way too much for the driver. A good car incites responsibility in the driver, in that the driver controls as much of the vehicle as possible and they have a sense of responsibility to be safe. People that have an overly simplistic view of driving mostly pushed by electric car companies won't be as skilled, and that's a fact.",

Your initial argument is about responsibility, what does that have to do with battery sustainability, of all things? \n\nBesides, basically all the things you mention are solvable. You can integrate sounds at low speeds to alert pedestrians and cyclists. You could simply limit torque output. And despite myths, they are generally much cleaner in terms of greenhouse gases and local pollutants than combustion engines.\n\nThere is certainly a discussion to be had with driver assist features, but these aren't even exclusive to electric vehicles. To ban them would be to use so broad a brush, I think it would cause much more harm than good.",

It'd be insanely dumb to allow sport cars to exist on the road and then ban electric cars for accelerating too fast\n2. it's already a legal requirement for electric vehicles to make noise below certain speeds in the U.S. This makes them louder than some gas cars at those speeds, so again really you're arguing for certain noise requirements, which some electric cars in today's market would meet and some gas cars would fail for being too quiet\n3. if weight is an issue, why are trucks allowed for recreational use? There are teenagers driving Ford trucks that weigh double what my electric car weighs. Why is that okay? Again, you want to have certain weight limits, which some electric cars would meet and some gas cars would fail\n4. waste for electric vehicles is frontloaded, they're far more efficient to run in the long term so if you're actually concerned about environmental impact, you'd tell everyone who doesn't buy a car every 2-3 years to go electric, especially used\n5. most electric cars have self driving on par with their gas counterparts\n6. we don't want driving to be a highly skilled task. We want to vastly remove the skill requirements involved so humans can be better at it. When I brake on a hill, my car never rolls back. It won't happen unless I tell the car to go into reverse. That's a much safer way to operate than gas cars, where a lot of people accidentally roll backwards into crashes on hills.",

                    "text": "1. on your first point, you shouldn't expect a first-time driver to operate a sportscar or electric car. In South Australia you need a high-powered license to do that, which requires already holding your general drivers license for some time.\n\nI never said we shouldn't have high performance vehicles, I said we shouldn't provide them to first time drivers. If you learned in a manual, have been driving for a while and want to buy an electric car to zip around, go for it.\n\n2. In Australia no such law exists\n\n3. Electric cars are much more deceptive about their weight. They might look like a small sedan but they're much more weight dense, the same volume but much more weight. At least in a big truck you know it's a heavier vehicle and handle it as such.\n\n4. Electric barely helps the environment, if people really cared they could just as easily ride a bicycle\n\n5. Petrol cars barely have self driving compared to electric\n\n6. Why make the requirements for a license less other than to just make money? The easier solution would be creating great public transport and bike infrastructure that offers better independence than driving does. The car industry suggesting it should be easier to get a license and making really user-friendly cars is actually not a good idea in the end because user-friendly = less experience required = worse drivers. They just see money from purchasing, to servicing, to fuel. Think about how much big petroleum wants everyone in a car.",

However, how much safer is someone driving a manual car vs automatic?

It had zero impact on how I drive an automatic vehicle. I guess I'm wondering... What's the perceived major downside to an automatic if data doesn't show safety is an issue.\n\nI look at it like a tool. If you know how to use the tool properly then it's fine. You can know less using an automatic and it doesn't appear to be to the detriment of anyone.\n\nThe downhill reference is a good distinction, however there is still downshifting and engine braking with automatic transmissions.

Cars usually don't need to do this and can just break, plus, braking is also a feature that people with automatics have to deal with. It's also an assumption that only automatic drivers are the ones that are tailgating these trucks. There is just no line of logic to be found here that leads to your conclusion directly. There will certainly be automatic drivers among these perpetrators, but because of statistical probability more than anything.\n\nThere is a point to be found here though, that driving automatic objectively makes you a worse, less dynamic driver than a driver that's able to drive a manual. I just don't think we need to reach so much as this post is trying to, to come to this conclusion.",

So they get a consultancy to put together a report. It's lobbying. And this is one of the dangers with a lot of talk about climate change.

A vehicle entering the roadway from the stall is more likely a surprise to others, especially a shorter vehicle.\n\n**TL;DR:** backing in, both the backer and others in the area have better visibility of the important areas and more warning for changes.\n\n**Edit:** I intentionally left out the parts about front-wheel steering, because I saw it'd already been mentioned.",

Backing in is also omega easy, in fact I would argue to some regard it is easier to back in nicely than it is to drive forward because you are pivoting around the axis you are driving in with. I certainly prefer to back in if the space is tight or the approach is narrow. I will concede that backing out is easier than backing in, but then going out forward is easier than backing out and driving in forward is certainly harder than driving out forward also.\n\nAlso backing in is one of the things on a driving exam, at least here, where you get 1 chance to do a correction manouver and with that if you fail to park you get to try the exam again next time.\n\nAlso why do you even need studies for this, your post is pure vibes. So a simple vibe check should tell you leaving a perpendicular parking spot forward is safer than in reverse, because you barely have any blind spots, especially by comparison. It also follows that backing out is slower than backing in, because you already have a good overview when going in so you only need to slow down when you are actually entering the parking spot, at which point people can potentially already start passing you.\n\nIt honestly sounds like you simply don\u2019t know how to back into a parking space.",

        "text": "The fact you think it would be appropriate for someone to *guide* you to reverse park just says that you are personally not very good at it and need practice. \n\nI hold the opposite view to you. With the exception of any situation where you, for example, need to wheel up a large item to the boot and you wouldn't be able to get it between the cars if you had reversed in, everyone should always reverse in.\n\nMaking slight adjustments left and right while parking is possible when reversing in a way it isn't going in forwards just due to the position of the wheels. Hence, people parking in forwards often have to drive the entire way out of the space to slightly readjust, which you don't have to do in reverse.\n\nMany people don't do that, and instead do the other problem intrinsic to parking in forwards, leaving their car at an angle because they've sort of stopped it mid turn. Most of the time, the aisle with spots either side is not wide enough to swing round a car and get it straight in the space in one go. At full lock, your car might barely be able to go in, almost scraping the nose of your car on one parked car and the door on the car on the other side, which forces you into a diagonal position at the end of the space. This is selfish as it makes it harder for the person on that side to open their doors.\n\nWhen reversing *into* a spot, you have full visibility and there is no danger. When reversing *out* of a spot, you have low visibility and are a danger to people around you.\n\nAnd, again, there is the issue with angles. Reversing out requires you to reverse straight for some time before initiating your turn or else you'll be scraping the nose of your car against another parked car. This requires a longer manoeuvre than driving out forwards.\n\nNow... I am from the UK. I am aware that US parking spots and roads are bigger, but I don't have a good concept of *how* much bigger. Many of the spots here are small enough that if everyone parked perfectly in the middle, many cars still likely wouldn't be able to open their doors to the first pop. If you are from the US and the spaces are absolutely ginormous and the aisles are three cars wide, most of my points are moot, except for the one about visibility when reversing out, but that alone seems like enough of a reason for you to change your view, IMO.",

    "text": "Americans often think they could crush Canada in a day and call it quits, that they could conquer the world easily, because of their large army and having half the world military expenditure for themselves, but reality is, wars aren't just won through numbers of soldiers and equipment: strategy, politics and circumstances all play a role. And a war doesn't end after an initial invasion.\n\nFirst of, Canada would see it coming, we'd be ready. Our military know each other well, yes, but we also each run our own simulations. It's not like our military has no strategy to draw this out as long as possible or attempt sabotage through our own spies. Even if we lack the strength, we could resist for many weeks if not months. But even after a surrender, there would be insurrectionists. That's where the real war begin. You can't declare victory until that's taken care of, and that's how you could lose. Imagine bombings and terrorism by canadians in U.S cities. Frequent assassination attempts of GOP politicians. Constant guerrilla warfare. And that's assuming Canada doesn't surprise you and hold the frontline longer than expected. The U.S is notoriously not good at dealing with guerrilla tactics, it prolonged many of your campaigns. This time it would be domestic and foreign guerrilla warfare at the same time.\n\nThen there are our allies. NATO is likely to chicken out, I admit, but they could surprise us. The U.K, France and Germany all remember WW2. They know letting Poland get invaded was Europe's biggest mistake at the time. They won't stand idle while a second imperialist monster is being born. Germany alone may want to atone by preventing WW3, who knows. If we can hold a few weeks, they could manage to send reinforcements. They will at the very least cripple the U.S with trade embargos and nuclear threats. Even Mexico might decide to help if they fear they could be next, and fighting a two front war is hard even on the most powerful of military empires. Then there's civil unrest. American soldiers may or may not obey such an order, and some desertion and low morale is to be expected. And morale matters in war. it's why the U.S had to give up on vietnam, the war wasn't supported anymore and the tactics employed by the enemy made them very good at holding out. And with Canadians pleading for their lives, the family and friends of many americans being canadians, and the complete travesty of a casus belli trump will manufacture to make this happen, it would be very hard to convince anyone but the most extreme MAGA to support that war. And wars that no one want to fight are lost wars. The strength of the U.S military is irrelevant since we have known for decades that the best way to win a war against americans is to get them to fight amongst each other about said war. And here, Canada wouldn't even need to push you, it would already be seen as madness. It's true for all wars the U.S conduct, get americans to hate the war effort, and they'll give up on their own. Here, you'd be attacking allies and people you share family and friends with. You would get instantaneous opposition, not the slow boil of wars across the atlantic. Trump would need to actually convince you to want to expand your dominion for this to even have a chance, and even then, how long could he maintain support once the resistance happens?\n\nEDIT: Reminder for people who aren't reading the full post, I \\*acknowledged\\* the U.S superior numbers and better equipment, I \\*acknowledged\\* that they would likely succeed in an initial invasion. I argued that they would struggle more than they believe and that the occupation would be a nightmare, that this would eventually end because the true weakness of the U.S in war... is their internal political wars.\n\nEDIT2: I already acknowledged the superior numbers and equipment, my arguments are made in spite of that, why is half the comments people not actually challenging my arguments but just repeating what I already conceded: I KNOW THE U.S HAS THE STRONGEST MILITARY, EVERYONE KNOWS IT. I argued it's not the only variables that matter in a real war. the U.S lost war against weaker opponents before. It can happen. Any country can lose against a militarily weaker opponent, because there is so much more to consider than sheer numbers.\n\nEDIT3: So if you read the deltas you realized it already, but I miscommunicated. I really meant war in a broader political sense. The focus on war logistics most people had were confusing to me because I thought my initial recognition of the materially undeniable might of the U.S was enough to show that wasn't what I focused on.

It doesn't seem beneficial to the USA.\n\nEdit: you also mentioned attacks on American soil. I think that would be the dumbest idea imaginable for a Canadian insurgency. Nothing has galvanized the American public in support more than attacks on US soil. Hell, we spent over 20 years in the middle east because of a relatively small but high impact attack.",

And 2) there would likely be a prolonged insurgency. \n\n(The way I see it you're agreeing with me Canada would lose the war and we're just talking about what happens after)\n\nI'm former US Army. I think you're overestimating how much easier it would be to fight a Canadian insurgency than the Afgans.\n\n1) You're very close logistics is not as much of a problem. IE if we see a target via satellite or radio, however it's found it could be hit likely within minutes.\n\n2) Canada is part of 5 eyes. The USA knows who all your soldiers are. Who their family members are. Where they live. Exc. The intelligence on Canada is much greater than Afgans and we at least have some shared language (I imagine if there was an invasion Canadians would speak French though)\n\n3) Terrain. Canada doesn't have a huge infrastructure created through decades of warfare of underground tunnels and places to hide from the sky. It's true you have a lot of Woods. But there are a lot of ways to find groups of people in the woods. If small groups want to stay undetected it basically means you can't have a fire. Moral drops quickly when people are hungry and cold.\n\n4) Which brings up another point, weather. Canada is generally colder. It's much harder for insurgencies to operate in colder areas.\n\n5) I think there is a question of, how the post invasion force would be received. Like the USA Canada right now is fairly divided politically. While I don't think anyone wants to lose their national identity I do think there would be a sizable portion of the population that would actually help USA forces to stop an insurgency. This could be for even the benign reason of getting back to normalcy.\n\nEdit: I'd also point out, you said the USA is notoriously bad at dealing with gorilla tactics. This is patently false, the USA has actually been very good at defending against this historically. Through both direct action and intelligence operations. Pointing at Vietnam or even the Afghan war really just proves my point. For example, less USA soldiers were killed in 20 years of fighting and occupying Afghanistan than civilians lost in the 9/11  attacks.",

How long do you think an insurgency stays organized without: food, power, or communications? IE survives a Winter under attack or occupation by the United States?\n\nBasically, your political instability argument, from a US perspective, seems null and void because retaliatory or insurgency attacks would galvanize the public and political classes. Not divide them.\n\nYou also seem to think things that matter a great deal don't matter much. IE let's just look at the number of active duty troops. Or even the populations. You need people to be insurgents. For example, everyone likes to think they would have fought against the Nazis in 1930s Germany. In reality it's only something like 1% of people.",

Canada has only 67,000 combat troops and support troops scattered across 27 facilities across Canada and most are just training facilities. In the first hours if a war the US would annihilate all bases with air superiority and cruise missiles. After that the war is over, Canada has strict gun laws, almost  no one inside the cities have any firearms at all, no access to weapons or ammunition or explosives, most rural Canadians do have a hunting rifle or two for gopher control or hunting, but that is all. Our border is largely undefended and we don\u2019t have military or vehicles to defend 3,000 miles of open border. You are completely delusional to think there would be any kind of effective resistance organized or not. We are woefully unequipped and unprepared to handle any type of invasion.",

But remember when the US occupied Afghanistan for over 20 years they only lost around 2.5k soldiers in that timeframe. Less USA soldiers died in 20 years of guerrilla warfare than civilians killed on 9/11.\n\nBeing this close to home, everything would only be easier. Especially for troop morale. US troops could have several week deployments instead of 15 months away from their families. Not to mention closer time zones for better communication with home.",

Let alone how other nations may react.",

There wouldn\u2019t be a war, just a very quick takeover. Tanks and IFVs would roll into the major cities and take over the capitols and broadcast stations. It would be over. \n\nThere won\u2019t be much armed resistance. One because Canada doesn\u2019t have many guns. Secondly and more importantly Canada doesn\u2019t have a cohesive national identity to rally behind. And I say this as a dual citizen. \n\nThe Chinese, Filipinos, Indians, Arabs, Africans? Not a chance they fight. The indigenous/First Nations? They\u2019ll just view it as one occupation replacing another. The Francophone Quebecois? Almost 70% of them identify with Quebec over Canada as of 2020. Also note that there was no meaningful armed resistance by French Canadians after French Canada was conquered by the British. \n\nThe white anglophone \u201cmainstream Canadian\u201d culture? This culture was once steeped in a strong identity as part of the British Empire like Australia and New Zealand. They loved the Queen and had the Union Jack on their flag until 1965. They were educated in a way that heavily emphasized British cultural heritage. Magna Carta, King Arthur, Shakespeare, etc. They were taught that they were loyal subjects of the British crown. \n\nThat culture is long dead. What is the white Anglophone culture now? Literally just American culture with slightly different accents, slightly different commercial products, and slightly more left-leaning politics. They\u2019re basically just Minnesotans. \n\nThere is no distinct culture or way of life that people will fight and die to preserve.",

Also, ive noticed that there seems to be much agenda pushing in tech these days...it's not normal and I'm considering a career change just to seperate from it. I'm sure it's the direct causation of the frameworks in which we are trained to work combined with our general human behavior that is a direct causation of our current temperaments.\nMy basic point is...let's try not to make this worse than we alreadyvknow it is....subject change...I would be totally up for a good larping tournament with canada, that would be fun.",

Just because it wasn\u2019t wrapped in military jargon and cosplay patriotism doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t valid. The Taliban had the advantage of generational guerrilla warfare in terrain they know like the back of their hand. Canada is not Afghanistan. That\u2019s literally the point. The tactics and the culture are completely different. If you think every war plays out the same way, I\u2019d argue *you\u2019re* the one who doesn\u2019t understand Afghanistan\u2014or Canada.\n\n*\u201cYou lost in Afghanistan.\u201d*  \nI was ten years old when that war started. I didn't lose anything\u2014I just watched adults make bad decisions for two decades and then act shocked when it didn\u2019t work out. If you think individual citizens are personally accountable for U.S. foreign policy, I\u2019ve got some French peasants you should meet from 1789.\n\n*\u201cYou don\u2019t understand Canadians.\u201d*  \nI've lived near Canada for years. Been there often. You have great people, good beer, and better manners\u2014but you\u2019re not some uncrackable fortress of resistance. Canada and the U.S. share more than just geography\u2014we share culture, language, media, and a lot of family ties. That works *against* the idea of a long-term, organized insurgency. There\u2019s no mass ideological separation. There\u2019s no hardened underground network waiting to strike. You might get some sabotage, sure, but this isn\u2019t going to turn into Northern Vietnam.\n\nIf the U.S. committed to a one-on-one war with Canada, it would win. Maybe not quickly, maybe not cleanly, but it would dominate the conflict. The military imbalance is too massive, and strategic resistance doesn\u2019t magically overcome overwhelming force. The hard part wouldn\u2019t be *winning*\u2014it\u2019d be *holding* anything long-term without turning global opinion into a PR wildfire. But that\u2019s not a matter of Canada\u2019s military strength. That\u2019s geopolitics.",

Neither did Iraq, when Bush Jr put up a mission accomplished banner after successfully overthrowing Saddam. See where I'm going with this...\n\nThe US would not be capable of maintaining control over Canada after the fact. Canadians would never accept US occupation. No military can control a population that united against being occupied. Trump severely underestimates the military resources it would take for the US to actually control Canadian resources. US resource extraction efforts would be sabotaged like no other. Canadians would be in a state of constant protest. Canada is gigantic and the US only has so many soldiers. \n\nThe US also has larger military ambitions. Resources for those ambitions would be tied up in Canada. Eventually, the US military would unravel. Imagine trying to invade Iran, as Israel demands of Trump, while trying to hold Canada, Greenland, and Panama militarily. The US military does not have the manpower.\n\nCanada cannot defend themselves militarily against the full force of the US military. Not even close. The Canadian military would be humiliated trying. But war is not over when the fighting between nation states is over. Canada would become an albatross around the US military's neck. Trump wants Canada for its minerals and for geostrategic reasons. A defeat of the Canadian military does not mean that the US can achieve its objectives. The result of an invasion of Canada, Greenland, etc would be the eventual collapse of the US military without ever directly losing to an opposing military. The logistical capacity of the US military would ultimately disintegrate under the strain of Trump's ambition.",

However, that only works if there is irreconcilable ideology and/or the country is occupying and not incorporating the territory.\n\nNeither of these are true in this case. 1) Culturally the USA and Canada are somewhat similar. 2) The USA wouldn't ever be leaving. This wouldn't be seen as a temporary occupation.\n\nI think it really comes down to one thing, how long does the insurgency resist? And that's largely dependent on the Conditions in post war Canada.\n\nFor example, what if public sediment in Canada after 20 years is that things are better than ever and people are happy with the change of political rules? That would lead to insurgency having much less support. If things are perceived worse than they would likely have more support.\n\nSo it's really hard to make any kind of meaningful discussion on the post war insurgency topic in terms of sentiment.\n\nWhat we can talk about is how an insurgency would be fought. This is where I think Canada will struggle. If they conduct gorilla warfare in the US mainland they will hurt their support among the US public (which was really the only reason the US left the middle east or Vietnam).\n\nBut they won't have as much supplies to fight an insurgency defensively in Canada.

But the high levels of separation between provincial and federal, and the extra separate powers Quebec has on top negotiated so we don't go independent, have made all Canadians provinces, and Quebec  doubly so, virtually mini countries. We do redistribute some federal taxes to the provinces for healthcare, just for equality, but really most of it is self funded by the provinces themselves, and each province has different healthcare systems with minute differences. Some have more privatisation than others, like Alberta (who unsurprisingly has the shittiest healthcare in Canada). You can get care anywhere in Canada, but the reimbursement is handled by your provincial government when you travel around. It's why my dad doesn't get it. Under an American government, that couldn't happen. A province control it's education, healthcare, and so so much more. Like, did you know that Quebec is the only place in Canada that uses french civil law but British common law for the criminal law? We are the only place in the world with a mixed legal system like that. Very unique.",

America has the largest airforce in the world, the United States Airforce, and the 2nd largest airforce in the world, the United States Navy. It could blockade Canada easily, preventing food and resources as well as aid, while bombing its cities and farmland to ash. If it wanted America could choke the world to death by blockading the Red Sea, and Straights of Malacca. This would kill any foreign power wanting to help that could help by cutting off their oil supply. There isn't a foreign power in the world excluding maybe France that can project power over the Atlantic Ocean to come to Canada's aid. Then we have to toss in how Canada has been under funding their own defense for decades.",

Assuming the Canadian military didn\u2019t immediately surrender, which I feel like they would because why die over this, if the U.S. sent the full force of its military they would have full control of Canada in a matter of weeks.\n\nYou\u2019re right that NATO would probably fold. However, their stance on the issue likely wouldn\u2019t matter. Again, the U.S. would have complete control of Canada before they could mount any type of response. \n\nNow as for the guerrilla warfare thing. I think only a small proportion of Canadians would have the stomach for that. Even then, it would depend on how the U.S. decided to play it. This is just my personal opinion, but I feel like the U.S. has struggled with guerrilla warfare and insurrectionists in the past from being too \u201cnice\u201d for lack of a better term. If they took a scorched Earth stance, where resistance or insurrection was met with nothing short of death and destruction, the resistance wouldn\u2019t last long.\n\nUltimately, I do agree that Americans over estimate the strength of their military. In the case of the U.S vs Canada though it would be like a soccer team in the English Premier League playing a U14 girls team.",

If I thought more, like I was trained to do, I would have seen how confusing my whole understanding of this is when you consider the title as well. I know the importance of clear definitions and statements and I failed to do so.",

So what\u2019s the objective?\u00a0\n\nIf it\u2019s to topple the regime and impose a puppet one I think that would be relatively similar to Iraq. Iraq arguably had a much more formidable military than Canada and while it\u2019s obviously a much larger area major population centers and the capital are relatively close and would be a pretty quick invasion. Where I\u2019d agree with you is that basically would mean nothing. You\u2019d have a government saying something from the capital and maybe a few collaborator govts listening but everyone else ignores it. Then you have an insurgency in some of the most hostile territory on earth.\n\nSo I agree and disagree. I think you overestimate how Canada would do in the conventional portion of such a hypothetical war. But I agree the US would have zero chance of dealing with the insurgency that would follow\n\nIn the end it would be disastrous for both and I would happily defect if such a war came to pass",

        "text": "To address the political aspects of your post:\n\n>Imagine bombings and terrorism by canadians in U.S cities. Frequent assassination attempts of GOP politicians. Constant guerrilla warfare.\n\nI think you might be drastically underestimating the sheer might and vast reach of US law enforcement and border security. The US got [really, really, really good at preventing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act) at this kind of thing after 9/11. You're gonna smuggle bombs and guns over the US border? You've almost certainly already been flagged by the FBI/NSA for posting that sentence online\n\nWhat guerilla fighters? Does Canada have anything comparable [to the US militia movement,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_militia_movement) a loosely organized collection of gun-toting right-wing lunatics who drill in the woods and foam at the mouth at the idea of getting to shoot foreigners/liberals? There are 60,000 of those guys, which is about the size of Canada's entire military\n\n>The strength of the U.S military is irrelevant since we have known for decades that the best way to win a war against americans is to get them to fight amongst each other about said war. And here, Canada wouldn't even need to push you, it would already be seen as madness. It's true for all wars the U.S conduct, get americans to hate the war effort, and they'll give up on their own.\u00a0\n\nI see where you're coming from, but I think a lot this argument rides on your preserved decency of the average American, which I would not take as a given after the reelection of Trump on a platform of abject fascism. The [US government is extremely good at propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States)), and the media landscape is abysmal. The Iraq war had an approval rating of 72% when it started in 2003, and it took 8 years to end despite it becoming extremely unpopular\n\nThe 30% of the US that voted for him would 100% be on board immediately. Moderate republicans would hem and haw at first, but fall in line eventually. Centrist pundits would start sliding the Overton window around with takes like \"well of course we all agree that security on the Northern border is important, but is this the right way to do it\" until it was normalized",

Especially since individually, european countries would have reasons to help us even if the whole alliance doesn't budge as unit. even china would consider it if they could coax something out of us. They understand that kind of diplomacy, that's why they help african countries with massive infrastructure and loans, to control them. They would offer help for more control, unpleasant, but better than being conquered. \n\n4:I believe NATO members and china would arm a resistance. And even a poorly armed resistance can do harm. Making explosives isn't complicated, and anyone can kidnap or kill with poor means. It would be desperate but not necessarily ineffective. Americans would hate bombings and assassinations in their cities from resistance fighters and sympathetic people in the U.S joining our cause.",

If Quebec is turned into a U.S. state and keeps all of their current laws, they would be fine. Of course people would protest and riot but there wouldn\u2019t be war. Their identity as Quebecer first (67% identify with Quebec over Canada) makes it easier for them to view it as Quebec as a distinct entity leaving Canada and joining the USA. Going from Canada second to America second isn\u2019t that extreme if Quebec is still first. \n\n2/3rds of Americans take their shoes off at home: \n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/most-americans-are-shoes-off-at-home/\n\nTruth is that \u201cgeneral Canadian culture\u201d and \u201cgeneral American culture\u201d are pretty much the exact same. The differences are entirely superficial. \n\nAs I wrote in my comment directly to your post, this wasn\u2019t always the case. 100 years ago white Anglophone Canadians were taught that they were loyal British subjects first and Canadians second. They really believed in it and were proud to be part of the British Empire. If they still had such a coherent identity then large-scale armed resistance would be feasible. But they don\u2019t. Nobody is going to take up arms proclaiming \u201cI\u2019m willing to die so that Canada can remain a multicultural melting pot for immigrants from all around the world.\u201d \n\nAnd then there\u2019s that whole thing where they don\u2019t have guns and the U.S. Navy can block any and all arms shipments from foreign countries.",

    "text": "I'm sort of piggy backing off a previous CMV about sex work and empowerment and I saw a comment that made a great point that you don't become \"owned\" or an \"object\" to be owned just because you offered and rendered services. And ultimately as a disclaimer I'm live and let live with sex work as it pertains to laws. I think sex workers should pay taxes and it should be treated as valid work history. \n\nBut. That doesn't mean I think it's a healthy thing for society or humanity to particularly indulge in. The person I was arguing with compared it to retail services or therapy or massage therapy. But personally I think there are core ways humans connect with each other that shouldn't just become yet another capital good or commodity in society. I think friendship should be free and not a subscription service. I think spending time with your family should be freely received and freely given. And I think certain spiritual services or mentorship  should by and large be free. Sex too. Anything that centers our connection with each other and functions as a way to bond with other humans...even if temporary...I believe should not be sold like a product. As soon as it becomes a product, the whole social interaction and bond or emotional  validation becomes a potential farce. In a way that encourages deceitfulness. Sex is not just like retail or eating at a restaurant.  It's a mechanism *evolved* to help us bond or feel less atomized or to ascend our illusions of being a solitary being. I mean. You can procreate too but seeing as our species has plenty of it without the intention to procreate i think it's evident its primary focus is connection. The brain chemicals released are about connection. \n\nI'm open to changing my mind since my views on sex work have shifted before...but this one I haven't quite shook. And I'm afraid that comparing sex work to other services like retail only feeds into my concern that we are all just becoming so capitalism brained that we are turning the very things that make us human into another product.  The things that can only be worthwhile and beautiful, if given for free. Curious if anyone has a perspective I haven't thought of. ",

Most animals purely follow their instincts and have no sense of long-term planning. Human beings can often rationally arrive at conclusions like \u201cWell, this cake looks really tasty, but I know for a fact that I'm allergic to one of the ingredients and that I will get a terrible rash if I eat it later, so however tasty it looks, I will restrain myself.\u201d.

I think OnlyFans works more like a casino in the sense that they use manipulation tactics to make their userbase keep spending or even spend more than they already do. I think OnlyFans can be extremely predatory, more easily so than traditional sex work. \n\nIt's like an online therapist that monetises the level of advice or listening time they are willing to give you based on how much you're willing to pay, and they're manipulating you to pay more by telling you that the 'answer' to your problem is juuust around the corner if you pay \u20ac10,- more or something like that.",

But your argument is specific;\n\n>\u00a0healthy\u00a0thing for society or humanity\n\n//\n\n>I think friendship should be free and not a subscription service. I think spending time with your family should be freely received and freely given. And I think certain spiritual services or mentorship should by and large be free. Sex too.\n\nThe problem with these claims are that sex work is not *becoming* that way, it has *always been that way*.\n\nSince the dawn of human civilisation, in the first written records we have - there was sex work. No matter how suppressed or what policies were put in place, there was sex work. When you give grapes to apes as a commodity, one of the first things that arises is sex work.\n\nFriendship as a subscription model is fundamentally alien to us - I know of no society that has done that. Same with family spending time together.\n\nReligions asking for money *is* something that has been done throughout history - but its always a balancing act. Most religious service must be offered for free if you want the masses to attend and believe - thus you request donations and charge for certain services - or run on taxes. But this is just the nature of running any organisation that will constantly need funds - and the specific ways religions have gotten their funds has varied quite a lot through time.\n\nBut sex work is a constant.\n\nWhat does it mean for something to be healthy for society? Because society is able to chug along quite happily with sex work existing in the background.\n\nWhat does it mean to be healthy for humanity? Because to answer that surely you'd have to answer the fundamental question - *what is human nature*? Good luck with that mate.\n\nSex work is like a river. Much like language evolution, the desire for intoxicating substances, love and many other human behaviours. You can channel the flow, but you cannot block it. The river will always flow around to meet the sea. Block it and you simply make a flood.",

        "text": "Okay you are absolutely right that intimacy and sex do involve a certain human connection. And while I'm no expert in the biology of it, there are definitely chemical responses in our brain towards bonding and so on.\n\nBut what, other than societal values that we can in much of the Western world trace back to various Christian morals, makes sex so special compared to other human interactions?\n\nWhat about an exercise/yoga/tai chi/whatever instructor giving private lessons? Exercise also has a chemical response on the brain and working with that individual over and over again especially will form a bond. Now of course the client is paying for the knowledge, expertise and service rather than the bond per day, but that same logic could be applied to sex. The bond just is part of being two humans sharing that experience.\n\nOr what about a bartender someone talks with at length regularly? Shall we ban them from talking so friendship incentivized through the sale of beverages doesn't occur? \n\nSure those are maybe out there examples, but the main point is sex is far from the only potentially bond forming human experience. Nor is it the only form of intimacy either.\n\nMy second point is you write a lot about the bond forming and connection between sexual partners. That is intimate, personal and potentially romantic sex. But sex is not always that. People, for free, because they want to, hook up and have casual sex. They have fun and walk away. There might be a little bit of temporary connection. Or it can be entirely mechanical.\n\nSex work can be selling the physical act of sex, not the intimate connection that may or may not go with it. That part is more up to each individual and their own mentality towards sex and intimacy.",

Of course they run a higher risk of not being that way because how well can you assess a strangers true intentions.  But it's entirely possible to have an encounter between two people that are both looking to just peer into another's humanity for a night, have some mutual pleasure and then part ways for a litany of reasons (not emotionally available for long term relationship, moving around geographically a lot etc).  That can still be honest sex. \n\nMasturbation? Idk i don't think that's supposed to be about connectedness really because it's more just about orgasm itself. And orgasm itself serves many purposes including sometimes just a natural sedative. And I think if masturbating fulfilled any goal of human connection then single people wouldn't get lonely because Masturbation would do the trick.",

Well said. It particularly bothers me because I feel that it embraces and profits from a culture that sees women in particular as sex objects. However, this view that it's wrong to commodify human connection can be applied to more than just sex work.\n\nI'll give one example. You mention that friendship and family connections should not be a paid service, and I agree. That said, a lot of people go to talk therapy purely because they need someone to listen and empathize with them. Not everyone goes to therapy for a deep psychoanalysis, and it's a mark of our isolated society that so many people do not have relationships that offer that kind of emotional support. Hence, it becomes a service. There is a lot of labor that we do for each other that would ideally be unnecessary in a more communal, connected world, but that's not the world we live in.

But we've also never been in a place where prostitution is legal.  Maybe if we ever found ourselves in Amsterdam and were feeling adventurous we'd revisit the idea.\n\nBut basically the idea is that neither of us had ever had a 3some but it was something that we were both a little curious about trying.  We don't want to go to the effort of finding a 3rd, especially because our ideal partner would be one that would guide us through the experience and focus on our enjoyment over their own.  And then we'd never talk to them again.  Which is a big ask, especially if you're looking for a woman.  So in the context of this conversation, we came to the conclusion that a professional made the most sense.  Because otherwise, we're basically looking for a pro that doesn't charge.",

Their motivation isn't \"capitalism\", it's much deeper than that. Or, maybe you could argue it's some sort of proto-capitalism.\n\nEverything else you said are musings, rationalizations, and projection about personal choices that people make. And that's great!

Sex is pleasant to encourage procreation, and pleasant behaviours can take on additional meaning in higher intelligence beings.

        "text": "I actually agree with you, but for the sake of the assignment, here goes:\n\nSex work and commodifying sex can be prosocial in certain situations.  If a John has a relationship where they are devoted to their partner, but their partner cannot physically or mentally tolerate the act of sex with them, such as an injury or illness, then going to a sex worker can be a way of keeping the boundaries of extracurricular sex very clear cut as a way to protect and sanctify the primary relationship.  \n\nAlso- people IRL have sex for a myriad of reasons outside of connection and love.  They have sex to manipulate or seek revenge or have a baby or to explore their own fantasies or whatever else thing you could imagine that has nothing to do with connection ALL THE TIME.  Sex that is transactional and without connection is not sole provenance of paid sex.\n\nAlso, sex is commodified indirectly in almost every facet of life.  The beauty industry, advertising, fashion industry, basically in nearly every way, the idea of sex is being sold. And even in the less obvious ways! Any time a man has spent a long time acquiring a skill, it\u2019s basically when you come down to it to increase his attractiveness to potential sexual partners. \n\nCapitalism makes every part of life commodified.  And it\u2019s inescapable. Friendships? Plenty of people give extra effort to their friendships that can give them access to certain opportunities, networks, or financial advantages.  Plenty of people are capable of compartmentalizing which of their friendships are formed on the basis of mutual advantage and which are their close and intimate friends. And it doesn\u2019t detract from their close friend relationships.",

        "text": ">But personally I think there are core ways humans connect with each other that shouldn't just become yet another capital good or commodity in society. I think friendship should be free and not a subscription service. I think spending time with your family should be freely received and freely given. And I think certain spiritual services or mentorship should by and large be free. Sex too. Anything that centers our connection with each other and functions as a way to bond with other humans...even if temporary...I believe should not be sold like a product.\n\nI disagree because I think transitory relationships are fine and they can be commodified. You don't always need a relationship, sometimes you need some random person to listen to you. You don't always need a connection, sometimes you just want to have sex. It's fine that these things are commodified because they are a service. Nobody is telling (largely) men to get addicted to them to replace their real relationships.\n\n>As soon as it becomes a product, the whole social interaction and bond or emotional validation becomes a potential farce. In a way that encourages deceitfulness.\n\nYour first problem is assuming that the interaction with a sex worker was anything more than that, an interaction with a sex worker. It would be better if more men understood this.\n\n>And I'm afraid that comparing sex work to other services like retail only feeds into my concern that we are all just becoming so capitalism brained that we are turning the very things that make us human into another product. The things that can only be worthwhile and beautiful, if given for free.\n\nThere was sex work before capitalism.\n\nI agree that sex should be free and abundant but I disagree with the framing that it's sex work that is the problem. I think the problem is the way our society views sex and promiscuity itself.",

If they feel that their connection with their loved one can\u2019t be replaced, should they deny themselves sexual connection with other people when they don\u2019t have to? \n\nSex is at the bottom of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy, as in it\u2019s a basal need for a healthy life. Allowing a monetary exchange to fulfill this need of having sex without having to violate their own standards of what they want in the sense of intimacy is a perfectly healthy way of allowing them to be satisfied without having to work to build another relationship for sex alone. In fact, it seems more wrong to force an 80 year old man or woman to begin another relationship solely to fulfill this need. By your own standards this would be exploitative, because they would form the relationship knowing it\u2019s not pure and only to fulfill the needs they still have after the death of their partner. \n\nI don\u2019t believe widows or widowers should be forced to exist in an unhealthy state, without sex, because moralists believe that satisfying that need without compromising their own beliefs about relationships is wrong. The moralists stance is unethical in this instance. They seek to deny a human need so they can feel better about other people\u2019s\u2019 behaviors that are none of their business. \n\nOnce you acknowledge this line of reasoning your whole argument falls apart. What about the disabled? Or people who are denied connections because they\u2019re ugly by societal standards? Or rape victims that need to be sexual but also need to place controls on how the experience plays out for their comfort? Your standards of purity don\u2019t take into account these very real instances that are assumed to not exist by your definitions. And then it\u2019s a slippery slope from there\u2014 if we allow these exceptions, why should a perfectly healthy and attractive man or woman be denied this type of access to sexuality without intimacy? What if they\u2019re in a fulfilling marriage ride with intimacy but their partner has a health condition where they can\u2019t be sexual anymore? If the partners decide together a meaningless exchange is ok, then that\u2019s their business.\n\nLife and people are a buffet. We can take one scoop of this or that from one source or another to be happy, and everyone\u2019s plate is different. Sure, it\u2019d be best for sex and intimacy to come from the same scoop, but if that isn\u2019t the case for someone else then why worry about it?",

        "text": "I think the problem here is equating physical and emotional intimacy. There's a correlation between the two, but they're not the same, and for some people they don't even correlate at all.\n\nFor example, have you heard of the split attraction model? One of the things it does is separate romantic and sexual attraction with regards to orientation to better categorize asexual and aromantic people. So asexual people can still experience romantic attraction without being interested in sex at all or having any sexual attraction to the people they fall in love with, while aromantic people can be incredibly physically attracted to someone without any interest in a relationship. But where it gets really funky is that even for people that aren't asexual or aromantic, they don't always match: it's possible for someone to be sexually attracted to women but romantically attracted to men, or vice versa. This is easiest to illustrate with bi people who only date one gender: they're attracted to both sexually, but they're only interested in a relationship with one. I can attest to having met at least one of those (a woman who was only into women romantically but had male friends with benefits). I mention that as an example of a case where sex can exist wholly independently of intimacy. Someone with a split attraction could visit a prostitute of the gender they're sexually attracted to without any extra emotional intimacy, possibly even while in a relationship with someone of the gender they're romantically attracted to.\n\nEven if that's an outlier case, it still demonstrates that it's *possible.* So we have to consider not only the possibility that people that are physically attracted to the prostitutes they visit aren't capable of being romantically attracted to them, but that even the ones that are also capable of being romantically attracted to them may not be. Consider, for example, the \"hot conservative woman\" archetype in conservative media and for conservative influencers, like the \"fox news blonde.\" As people, I find them revolting: most of them argue for things that I think are fundamentally threatening to our democracy and hold what is, in my opinion, a callous disregard for the plight of others. I could never be in a relationship with one of the. But they're *hot.* Physically, they're extremely attractive, which is part of their brand and how they get followers. I can be attracted to them sexually and want absolutely nothing to do with them emotionally. That works the other way around too: I'd seen my last girlfriend around at the activity we met at, and I didn't think she was particularly remarkable until I wound up hanging out with her for a couple of hours as part of the activity, after which I was head over heels.\n\nTaking that into account, I think it's difficult to argue that an intimate (in any sense of the word other than a euphemism for sexual, anyway) connection is an inherent part of sex work. There are people that will develop such a connection to a prostitute they visit regularly, but that's a risk at any customer facing profession. There are a lot of service workers that have stories about customers stalking them, and many more that have stories about customers just being creepy at them.",

Does sex have to be romantic to still be about connectedness? I might not want a romantic relationship with a woman but through sex I'm still connecting with her and that's exciting. I'm not sure if this just is devolving into semantics then though. And what I think of connection, other people are perceiving as deep intimacy. It's an intimacy imo but doesn't have to be that deep. But idk maybe you can elaborate and sway me further.  Maybe I'm just not using words fairly.",

                "text": "So what makes that connection special in comparison to non-sexual connection to you? I think that's the key here. *Something* about it is different to you. \n\nDo you have the same opinion about close contact sports like wrestling? If not, then it's probably not physical contact. But there's still something different about sex.\n\nDo you have the same opinion about fiction? If not, then it's not an emotional connection based on a lie. But there's still something different about the connection being with you, specifically, than the audience, which is why streamers and whatnot are so much more parasocial than actors.\n\nIn the end, I really don't know what it is. It's a difficult topic. Most of the world treats sex with enough mystery that they rarely think about it logically, so there's more work to be done if you ever start to. It could be cultural conditioning because of how the world treats sex, it could be a perception of a power imbalance because only the customer's pleasure matters, it could be a personal hangup, it could just be the fact that sex requires a connection *for you* even if it doesn't for other people.\n\nCould I suggest amending your view rather than entirely changing it? Maybe it's just that for *you*, sex would have to be about connection. If that's the case, then all you have to do is acknowledge that it isn't necessarily that way for others change your view from a prescription for society to a personal preference, and then it's valid whether you can support it intellectually or not. I think you're most of the way there already in supporting its legalization, you're just still attaching a stigma to it because it's something you wouldn't be interested in, which is a natural human reaction.",

It\u2019s just that Disney is pushing what they call progression into their movies. In my opinion including *characteristics* that aren\u2019t typically in films is definitely progression and it\u2019s good to see representation. But all of their movies focusing on that and not the concept of the franchise itself kills it. \n\nThis is the least offensive way I can put it. Imagine a character called *Tangerine* because that\u2019s the colour of said character. Now imagine a Disney reboot of Tangerine but the character is now blue. It doesn\u2019t change the story or ruin it in any way, but it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Viewers see Snow White played as a non white character and it feels odd. Feels like she was hired for the role more than just because she can act well. I\u2019d feel pretty used if I was in a movie not because of my skills, but skin colour. In the name of progression, yet nothing has improved. In fact we have regressed purely because the point of the film wasn\u2019t for entertainment, but to spread a message. Disney was never going to hire a white person. And at the end of the day it\u2019s racial exclusivity. You might not believe white people can be victims of such, but they can. Why should a white woman not be given the part because of her skin colour. \n\nAgain, not being racist, even though it sounds it. If Disney wasn\u2019t doing all this then hiring Zegler would have been completely fine. It\u2019s just because it\u2019s obvious that white culture is now seen as the problem, even though the majority of us were born less than 30 years ago and haven\u2019t done shit. ",

My ex during our time didn\u2019t have a celebrity crush or at least that I was aware of hence this is not coming from my own experience with this. It applies to both men and women. \n\n\nI myself don\u2019t have a celebrity crush. The last one I had was on Debby Ryan when i was around 9-10 years old. Now sure when I look at Dua lipa I think she\u2019s good looking but I am not \u201ccrushing\u201d. I\u2019m not stalking her social media, fantasising scenarios with her , commenting sexual things on her posts , talking to my friends about her or making edits of her on TikTok. I\u2019ve had crushes on girls in my day to day life that I\u2019d approach or try to flirt with , on of them who is now my ex. \n\n\nHaving a celebrity crush in a relationship is cheating. I don\u2019t know why people try to justify it , personally I see it as not loving your partner enough for you to try and defend that. Like you are actively having romantic and sexual thoughts and feelings for someone else besides your partner. Your partner was once a crush - look where it has come to now. \n\nAlso people always use the excuse that they are unattainable and won\u2019t ever meet them; first of all they live on the same earth and while there is a lower chance , you can still bump in to them in real life , I once met YouTuber Mo vlogs at Amsterdam Schiphol airport when I went there. Some women also find someone more attractive if they are unattainable and hard to get , they also find them more attractive when they see that others think the same (I have heard these ideas on the internet and can\u2019t say for sure that it is 100% true for women so take it however you want to). \n\nCelebrities also in general are more attractive (can be subjective) higher status and wealthier, things that make them more desired than the average person. This is not a defeatist view but celebrities on those terms are \u201cbetter\u201d and you can never quite live up to that unless you become one. \n\nYou are actively saying that x celebrity is better and you want them but can\u2019t since they don\u2019t know you exist so you settle for someone attainable. Most people if given a chance would leave their partner for celebrity crush and even if they didn\u2019t , they\u2019d still have the desire but not want to in order to it be seen as bad or to hurt their partner. \n\n\nCHANGE MY VIEW !",

Over what time frame? Who else knew about it? What are you charging them with?\n\nWe already know Trump\u2019s DOJ works very quickly.

In fact, they haven\u2019t even shown they are actually investigating *anything* related to DOGE\u2019s work.\n\nIf the fraud was there and they wanted to find it, they would have by now\u2014and they would have named and shamed the fraudsters. \n\nSince they have declined to prosecute the fraud they claim to have evidence of, I believe it is safe to assume that, going forward, anyone accused and charged of these frauds will likely be a political enemy of someone in the Trump regime and could even be victim to evidence fabricated by DOGE.\n\nChange my view!",

They don't particularly care about whether there was actionable fraud, but they want to make a political statement to state that there was. They are putting this to the court of public opinion more so than a legal court.\n\nOnce this is investigated, if it turns out that there was no real fraud (just decisions that the current administration did not like) then it will just get reported as a tiny footnote in conservative media and the people will just remember the initial allegation.\n\nThe difference with DOGE and the EPA is that DOGE was set up to find fraud, so it seems more plausible for them just to publish their bogus fraud findings on their website. The EPA's purpose is not to find fraud or do any investigation, so to appear legitimate they need to publicize their referral of the fraud case rather than just post about the fraud itself.\n\nOf course, whenever I use the word \"fraud\" you should insert the word \"alleged\" in front of it.",

If someone's been hiding their fraud for a long time, odds are you're going to have to work to find it, and this flagship department doesn't want to risk their first target getting off scot free.\n\nAlso, of course, we can be pretty sure *someone* is committing fraud in the Federal Government. Like, your claim depends on *none* of the 3 million people working in the federal government embezzling money in a way an investigation would pick up on, which seems extremely unlikely.\n\nWhat I think is much more likely is that DOGE *has* found evidence and is waiting for the chance to make a show trial and example of whoever they found. Maybe, if they had no evidence, they'd resort to framing people, but it's more likely they're waiting for the right moment to hammer some poor bastard who's been lying about their expenses really hard.",

We can basically dismiss the social media posts, as they'd be identical in every situation.\n\nMy point is that its much more likely that they will find some kind of fraudster - probably relatively quickly, as you say its easy enough to find the abnormalities and then begin the proper investigation - and hold them up as their big case rather then find nothing and have to make something up. This is what generally happens in these kind of cases - there's rarely a situation where you can't find anyone who's broken *some* law if you look hard enough, and you usually get \"massive over-punishment of minor crime\" rather than \"completely made up crime\" in this situation.",

This is part of the reason why it took so long for prosecutors to indict Trump after he left office in 2021.\n\nI think a better argument for you would be \"DOGE won't end up finding a large number of people who could reasonably be charged with fraud\" instead.",

    "text": "Sam Harris and many other philosophers and thinkers have this idea that our morality is based upon what is biologically necessary for us. So that would mean that helping people live their best lives is morally correct because it gets us to a state of optimal human flourishing.\n\nThis is utterly ridiculous.\n\nThere is nothing that human beings *have* to do on a biological level. We don't have to explore other continents. We don't have to build things and make them pretty. We don't have to make clothes for other people. We don't have to save a drowning child that isn't ours. We don't even have to be nice to our own kids. The human race can continue even if we're at our most selfish. Yeah, sure we wouldn't be happy but the race would still be here. You can't ground morality in biological truths because there isn't that much that we have to do on a biological level to sustain ourselves. We could literally live in a nightmare world where women are forcefully impregnated like in the handmaid's tale and the species would continue. There's nothing that says that we have to try to get closer to an optimal state. That sounds fairly Christian to me. \ud83d\ude01 \n\nMathew 5:48 \u2013 \u201cYou shall therefore be perfect, as your Father, Who is in Heaven, is perfect.\u201d\n\nBut then again, it's not like most of these atheist philosophers actually care about getting to an optimal state. They want people to indulge as much as they want, don't they? Which isn't optimal. \n\nAlso, other primates do horrible, selfish things too and are still around today doing pretty well. Male silverback gorillas kill the offspring of rivals. Chimpanzees literally start wars when it would be much better not to. Dominant chimps abuse and beat lower ranking chimps to keep them in line. And orangutans often commit rape. \n\nConclusion: Morality cannot be tied to biological needs because humans can be incredibly selfish and do a lot of harm and still go on living. And I don't think that you could argue that there is a certain quality of life that nature demands. ",

        "text": "The problem you identify with Sam Harris\u2019 moral landscape idea is correct, it just also applies to religious morality. It\u2019s called the grounding problem.\u00a0\nChristians will argue morality is based in god.\n\nEthics as a philosophical principle is what one \u201cought\u201d or should do.\u00a0\nWe are all familiar with what are called hypothetical imperatives.\u00a0\n\nFor example, IF you want to do well on your test THEN you should study is objectively true.\n\nJust like\u00a0\n\nIF you want to have fun, THEN you should go out with your friends is also true.\n\n\nEthics has to do with Categorial imperatives. In other words what\u2019s the right thing to do no matter what. Sam Harris says because we all want to be happy and all want to avoid pain we can find objective answers to how to produce that for the most people. Christians say you should do what god says.\n\nBut these are both equally empty. Moral facts don\u2019t make any sense. There is no fact about the world that tells you what you should do. What you should do will always depend on your goals which themselves are dependent on a whole bunch of things like your genes, environment, early childhood experiences, \u201cyour soul\u201d for lack of a better word. Even if there is a God there still can\u2019t be a categorical imperative. You can say \u201cIF you want to avoid hell, THEN you should do what god says\u201d but if you don\u2019t then you shouldn\u2019t. That means no matter what ethics and morality will always be subjective. There\u2019s no way around it.\u00a0\n\nYou can just define good as \u201cwhatever god says\u201d but then good becomes a meaningless term. It\u2019s just whatever god says. If today god says murder is bad it\u2019s bad if tomorrow he says it\u2019s good it\u2019s good. But the murder itself is meaningless.\u00a0",

        "text": "The argument that morality is tied to biology is typically made in descriptive, rather than normative, terms: humans across the globe typically share certain core morality about how to treat one another and behave in society because these morals were adaptive in a social species. Our ancestors who had this internal morality were able to cooperate with one another - and avoid murdering and hurting one another - out-competed those who could not. Under this argument, morality thus functions like every other emotional construct: it is, fundamentally, a cocktail of responses to stimuli that our hard-wired into our genetics, because those genetics were the ones that survived and were passed down.\n\nWhile this explanation is pretty good in that it accords with the way we understand many other human behaviors, there are two things it doesn't do, and isn't trying to do:\n\n1. It doesn't explain how this genetic pattern for morality arose in our ancestors. But evolutionary arguments never do: they rely on the idea that beneficial mutations arise randomly, and, having arisen, will spread and be selected for.   \nWhether this explanation is parsimonious to you will depend on your priors for randomness generally - how much randomness you think there is in the world, and how much complexity you think can arise out of random chains of events. However, even if you dismiss the idea that these mutations are entirely random, and see some sort of \"design\" in them, the *mechanism* by which this design is enacted is well understood: selection.\n\n2. It doesn't \"ground\" morality ontologically - i.e., it doesn't actually say anything about whether this cocktail of responses humans have has any relationship with objective moral values and duties. It isn't saying anything about that one way or another, since that question is beyond the purview of biological science.\n\nThis is where Sam Harris makes his mistake: he assumes that \"badness\" is a real feature of biological reality, and tries to support that assumption not by means of deductive argument, but by means of a thought experiment (\"the greatest possible suffering\"). This thought experiment often works for him rhetorically, since almost no member of his audience will ever respond with something like, \"Well, you're assuming that human suffering has some sort of real moral value. But you haven't actually substantiated that.\" This will make them look ridiculous to their peers, because most people are very invested in their internal sense of morality corresponding to something \"real\" whether they have philosophical foundations for it or not. But that doesn't make the critique any less accurate.\n\nSo in sum: morality *is* tied to biological needs, if what we mean by morality is \"the way humans feel about the goodness and badness of things,\" i.e. descriptive morality. If, however, we mean \"the way sapient creatures ought to behave,\" i.e. prescriptive morality, then there is no obvious way to ground it in biology, or chemistry, or physics, or any feature of the material world at all.",

Nature and biology cannot tell us what is right and wrong because there is a lot of evil that could still exist without us needing to improve. Chimps don't try to redeem themselves when they cannobolise eachother. Nature is not about being good, it's about having a good strategy.",

The human race can continue even if we're at our most selfish. Yeah, sure we wouldn't be happy but the race would still be here. You can't ground morality in biological truths because there isn't that much that we have to do on a biological level to sustain ourselves.

There's nothing that says that we have to try to get closer to an optimal state. That sounds fairly Christian to me. \ud83d\ude01 \n\nI think you're misunderstanding the point.  It's that that biology dictates that a person MUST act in a particular way.  It's that it creates situations where it is advantageous to act in one way or another.  And, for a species that has the teamwork and abstract thinking abilities to punish members for acting in an anti-social way, it can be beneficial to the individual to act in a pro-social way.",

By human flourishing, Harris is not talking about doing what continues the species.\n\nHis view is that moral questions have objectively right and wrong answers grounded in empirical (i.e. biological) facts about what causes people to flourish. One of his often cited examples is that throwing acid in women's faces is immoral because it harms their flourishing.\n\nIf continuing the species required massive suffering, that wouldn\u2019t be moral by his standard, because it would lower human flourishing. Extrapolating from his views, I'd say that he would allow a future with fewer humans but greater average flourishing, compared to one with more people but more suffering.\n\n> You can't ground morality in biological truths because there isn't that much that we have to do on a biological level to sustain ourselves. \n\nThat's a weird way to put it. Most moral theories take biological facts into account. As soon as you talk about suffering, death etc. those are all facts tied to someone's biology.",

They have very different patterns of reasoning and reacting. \n\nMorality is a social norm enforced  across the population to prevent sociopaths from normalising their behaviour.\n\nIt's not perfect. It works just well enough (as all of evolution) that we've come to where we are today - which is fairly good.\n\nSo contrary to what you think - morality is all about biology because predation exists only in the context of biology in particular the reproductive element.\n\nMorality concerns itself with sexuality because sexuality is where first instances of in-species predation existed.  Both in terms of males predating on females, females aggressing against males and females, and both males and females predating on children.",

A lot of which that we've let slide and that we haven't bred out of the species. The only thing we can say about morality on a biological level is that sometimes we want to hurt people and sometimes we want to share things with them. Sharing things and being kind makes us happier and allows us to be stronger. We grow empires because we cooperate. We make alliances because we cooperate. But you can't say there's something good about those empires. But you can't say there's something bad about turtles and snakes not raising their children and not building empires.",

True, there is no reason we *must* live the type of lives we live and treat each other the way we do, but evolution doesn\u2019t always deal in necessity. Sometimes, beneficial evolutionary traits develop even when the species could have survived without them.\n\nAs an example, all birds share an ancestor, but some modern birds can fly and other cannot. So, obviously, it is possible for birds to survive without flying. However, the groups that did evolve flight performed better in their specific environment.\n\nLikewise, humans perhaps *could* have survived without helping each other, but our cooperation is part of what made is the dominant species on the planet. It is specifically *because* other animals do not cooperate as much as us that we were able to overpower animals that are much stronger and faster than we are. So, groups of early humans that did not help each other would have died much faster. And groups that did cooperate were able to pass on whatever genes that made them more likely to cooperate. That\u2019s how evolution works.",

Like yeah, the reason why any person is good is because they're capable of doing terrible things but they don't.

We have a similar programing (to a lesser degree) for children in general, it's biologically hardwired to treat kids better than adults. And nobody made clothes for other people for the hell of it, even before currency was invented people were trading favors and resources among themselves. Not liking to work for free is another trait that's biologically hardwired.",

You're saying since some people survive despite being shit, everyone can be more shit. But you're ignoring that fact that you're more likely to survive and do better if you're not shit.\n\nLike being a valued member of your community means you're less likely to be murdered and more likely to be helped in times of need, being nice to your children means they are more likely to survive and live to have children of their own. Sure you can pull through without doing those things but it's less likely so people are generally biologically geared towards doing those things, at least more so than not. You don't see that most \"morals\" improve odds of survival and/or propagation of the species, that's not a coincidence. \n\n>Oh, okay. Well yeah, most people wouldn't do a thing if everyone hated them for it because we're social creatures.\n\nThat's kind of my point. Morals are downstream from biological needs.",

    "text": "They're making money off war. They're making money off war aesthetics. They're marketing war as a cool thing.\n\n\nMore than ever, war-related videogames are booming. Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty and so many others, even Fortnite, normalizing onto society concepts like saying they 'killed someone', guns and military equipment. This all has a purpose - a preparation for war, so when we get drafted, we think it's just like the videogames.\n\n\nAnd this evil scheme has too many tentacles. Women - veteran and active duty - of all forces around the world are purposedly sexualizing themselves, objectifying themselves, with the evil objective of capturing men and women into thinking soldiers are good, that such a combo is good - it's okay to be in the military, there's hot women (look up for Lujan, Brynn Woods & the Israeli Defence Force case of active duty and reservists making 'thirst traps')\n\n\nPrivate military companies - Blackwater/Academi, Wagner Group, and Forward Observations Group, all of them surfing on the theme, with everyone more or less knowing about wars, with everyone becoming more and more political. Showing how cool it is to also be a \"contractor\", outside of the armed forces, seeking to capture the veterans and even those who want to do something 'military' yet for personal reasons do not want to join the ranks of their national army. These are like a cancer - profiting off the removal of the term mercenary which is obviously negative, in a brandwashing typical of the modern world. We must remember what they truly are: MERCENARIES. And they will always be despicable and worthy of our most strong and constant hate and disapproval. God I hate PMCs with a passion specially because of that attempt to hide what they are with that brandwashing.\n\n\nThus, they're covering the whole cycle: normalizing war aesthetics and war efforts for civilians, normalizing and giving incentive to those who do wish to join the armed forces, and giving incentives to those who want to 'gear up' but do not have much love for their country or seek non-national related incentives.\n\n\nWho's this 'they'? Well, you name it. But I clearly see a trend of normalization, incentives and glorification of war lately.\nCMV!",

The whole purpose of war is the inherent glory that must not be glorified. Is it bad ass to singlehandedly take down 20 enemies? Yes. Did you just destroy 20 families? Also yes. And the guy that actually did it usually never recovers. The issue with this take is that there very much is glory to war. We just can't allow that to actually sway our minds or opinions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBut just so we're clear, in a time where despotism and authoritarianism are on the rise, appeasement is NOT the solution. I'm not going to ever argue for war, but like George Orwell said.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist. This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one side, you automatically help out that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, 'he that is not with me is against me'.\"\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand that advocating for war when we are at peace is folly, but advocating that we are at peace when we are at war is even more insane.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit* the reason I ignored the mercenary comments is because mercenaries are up there with prostitution. As long as there's a need, there's a supply. Call them PMC, Merc, Privateers or brigands, they emerge as a systemic response to real problems. Mercs all come from poor backgrounds. 3rd world country mercs fight for governments when no one wants to, first world mercs fight when the pay is worth their death.\u00a0",

One was security for a fishing ship off the east coast of Africa and while in port in Mogadishu. They protected the ship from pirates. Is that evil? The second contract he worked was personal security for the head of a fishing company whose insurance company required him to have security. That was just being armed in plane clothes and hanging around the guy and they were in Sweden I believe. Again nothing evil. The contest I was considering when I got out of the Army was for a year as a guard at the U.S. embassy compound in Kabul. Not super bad if you ask me.

War may be inevitable, and if that is the case, then you have to choose: do you want to side with the people glorifying war to oppress or the people selling the idea that to fight the oppression and return to peace is the highest glory?  I'm canadian. We feel the fear of invasion, the fear of traitors among us too ( my own dad is pro annexation by the U.S and said he wouldn't care if the U.S invaded us. It terrified me to hear that). We know conflict is on the horizon, but we don't want to fight just because we are glorified zealots like our enemies, we want to fight to protect our homes, protect our freedom. If Trump invades canada I will take the arms, and believe me, no one is more surprised to hear that than me. I used to say I would sooner be imprisoned for desertion than get drafted in a war. But if the war comes to me? You can bet I won't go down in dishonour. Starting wars is horrible, ending them is our moral duty. My father may be a misguided traitor for now, but would he really feel the same if his son was drafted into this mess? Idk. My point is, the previous commenter is right, don't be surprised war is normalized, be disgusted the wrong justifications for it are being invoked. Normalizing conquest and pillaging is monstrous, but normalizing standing up against that isn't. We should all want to end wars swiftly,there's great honour in that. There's no honour in rejecting violence when violence is the only option left.",

My government will do ALL it can to avoid war, I believe that, but Trump may give us no choice, and submitting to him to avoid fighting would be to explicitly endorse this notion that might makes right, that violent monsters can take all they want in impunity. Right now, I have to hope you americans wake up and stop him, but if you don't, I have to be ready to face reality. And the same is true for you. Are you ready for a civil war? Trump may declare a de facto martial law by april 20. If that happens, you either need to resist him with violence or give up. Your legal and peaceful resources are almost all gone. Trump doesn't let judges stop him anymore, the law doesn't apply to him. And soon, your rights will be void. You are out of options. Trump doesn't care for peaceful protesters, and soon he'll send the military to arrest them. What will you do then? Sometimes, violence IS the best option. By shedding blood now, you may prevent a bloodbath later.",

Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporations.\n\nNow this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence\u2014economic, political, even spiritual\u2014is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society.\n\n\\> In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\n\n  \n\\> The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocation, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.\n\n\\>Yet in holding scientific discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.\n\nPresident and General Dwight Eisenhower (presidential farewell speech)",

It is perhaps not particularly well evidenced, but it doesn\u2019t seem to me to be that far off. There is a LOT of money to be made off of war. Lots of companies profit from war and not just war, but the militarization of police. The US Department of Defense is the most bloated over-funded organization in our government (and compared to the defenses of other countries combined) but the people who say they are interested in efficiency and waste are woe to examine how the DOD sucks up tax payer money and spits it out at whatever new weapons or war machines are available, whether the machines are critical to national defense or not.\u00a0\n\nThe US runs on exporting war\u2014particularly the proliferation of weapons of war. Our weapons are found throughout the world. Ukraine, Israel, the cartel, etc., whether the cause is worthy (Ukraine) or not (the cartel).\u00a0\n\nIn the US, war is glorified. There is honor in war. It is disturbing. I live here. And I am a daughter and a granddaughter of veterans of foreign wars.\u00a0\n\nIt is perhaps not an organized or concerted effort, but military advertising campaigns (that is, propaganda) are effective and dip deep into impoverished areas to exploit those who have fewer resources.\u00a0\n\nThe media sells well because the DOD has a vested interest in making sure that the people are on board\u2014in support of the massive military budget in the name of national defense. Other countries do not face the same military propaganda in the US. And whether other countries buy into to military video games as much I don\u2019t know (but I\u2019m curious and I\u2019m going to look it up know). But the US military has had an influential advertising campaign that has propagandized the public into supporting war efforts whether or not they serve national defense. And anyone critical of military efforts has had to make explicit distinction between supporting the troops but not the war, because those who have an interest in military power have equated criticisms of military efforts with maligning soldiers.\u00a0",

[Take Ukraine](https://icct.nl/publication/foreign-fighters-foreign-volunteers-and-mercenaries-ukrainian-armed-conflict)  as an example. When that war started many mercenaries travelled there, many US ex-special forces in fact, to help train the Ukrainian military in small unit tactics. This improved the combat effectiveness of the Ukrainian military and helped them defend their nation.",

Though many keep military\u2019s because that is how you enforce peace, Plain and simple. If you don\u2019t want another nation going to war with you or your allies, you make a hell of a lot more of an argument when you have the force to back up your words. Now I have already agreed with you that pmc\u2019s are deplorable. But the armed forces of a stable and peaceful state are quite the opposite. They are disciplined and comply to their nations laws as well as global laws. They typically are deployed as peacekeeping forces for the UN, military advisors/instructors for nations that are in defensive wars, or they are deployed within their nation during times of crisis. They are typically viewed poorly if they are aggressive or warmongering, look at the international condemnation Russia received after their \u201cmilitary operation\u201d in Ukraine.",

For example, he says, a higher number of males in a group and greater population density\u2014which the researchers used as indicators of adaptive strategies\u2014could equally be the result of human disturbances. Sussman also criticizes the team for mixing observed, inferred, and suspected cases of killings, which he calls \"extremely unscientific.\"\n>R. Brian Ferguson, an anthropologist at Rutgers University, Newark, in New Jersey, agrees, adding that other assumptions the team made\u2014such as using larger chimp territories as a proxy for more minimal human disturbances\u2014could be wrong, because \"some populations within large protected areas have been heavily impacted.\"\n\n\nWhether chimp conflicts are analogous to human war, I don\u2019t know. It seems the data are equivocal from the sources you\u2019ve provided.\u00a0\n\n>their intergroup violence and raiding behaviors is not at all analogous to warfare?\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnalogous\u201d has a specific meaning in evolutionary biology. For instance:\n\n>Bird and bat wings are\u00a0analogous\u00a0\u2014 that is, they have separate evolutionary origins, but are superficially similar because they have both experienced natural selection that shaped them to play a key role in flight. Analogies are the result of\u00a0convergent evolution.\n\nhttps://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolution-101/the-history-of-life-looking-at-the-patterns/homologies-and-analogies/\n\nGiven that the functions of chimpanzee conflicts and human war are not clear, it doesn\u2019t seem possible to say whether they are analogous or not.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also no way scientifically to prove a negative. The burden of proof always lies with the one making the claim; not with the person who is requesting evidence for the claim.\u00a0",

Like any other hard job, you need experienced people to do it properly. Countries in conflict (or preparing for one) need experienced people to fill combat jobs. They also need experienced people to teach their new hires how to do those jobs. \n\nAt the same time, certain countries have had lots of war recently. America alone has had millions of troops cycle through combat zones in the last 30 years. During that entire time there is a lot of guys getting out of the military who realize they have become quite good at waging war and can make a lot more money being an experienced contractor vs trying to go into some entry level \"regular\" job. Many of these dudes are neutral towards their clients. They're not guarding a sheikh or training Saudi troops because they hate Yemen, they're just doing it because its way better to be paid 250k a year doing that than serving milkshakes for $10 an hour or painting rocks at the military base because their country is at peace. \n\nThere are also those who are genuinely ideologically aligned with their clients. If I support Ukraine, why the hell should I sit at home if I could potentially go and fight the Russians and get PAID for it too. Many \"mercenaries\" are just dudes who decided that imaginary lines on maps aren't going to stop them from fighting for their beliefs. There's stories of anti-commie Americand traveling to fight around the world. Why is a American soldier doing that fine but not a private citizen? \n\nDon't get me wrong, there are some sad evil freaks who are chasing killing or brutality, but that's not most of them. \n\n\nFOG, Wagner and Xe or whatever blackwater is called these days are just some of the more popular companies (is FOG even an actual pmc company?), and like any job, they want to feel good about what they do and attract more people. They'll use whichever marketing strategy gets them that. Just like bankers use the \" I work 24h a day but I get mad money and party hard\" vibe to attract young smart motivated people, BW and others have just figured out that making this shit look cool and playing into the lawless wild boy vibe is what gets them people. \n\nLastly, think of cops, which pretty much are the same as mercs. Plenty of cops move to high risk cities to get the higher salaries those places offer. That doesnt mean they are chasing arrests or trying to kill. Plenty of cops move to high risk cities or special units because they legitimately hate criminals and want to eliminate them. That doesn't make them bad people. And lastly, there are plenty of cops who like to oppress and impose themsleves on others and do those jobs because it lets them do that. That doesn't mean all cops or cop promoting social media firms or businesses are assholes ans evil.",

    "text": "If the Republicans' obsession with the budget deficit and national debt was at all valid, the solution would be to raise taxes on the rich (top 0.1% take in 10% of the country's income), and you would not waste time on minor portions of federal spending like USAID (0.3%) or Medicaid or SNAP or FEMA. It makes no sense to gut education and critical services further to protect the rich.  \n\n\nThe national debt is a fraction of U.S. household net worth. There is no crisis. \n\nThe US is still a rich country, but wealth is hoarded. Should we have trouble, a 1% wealth tax on the top 10% would make the deficit sustainable indefinitely. We can end the $1 trillion per year in tax expenditures for the top 20% otherwise.",

I just don't get it. Drugs are evil and should not only be banned (the total opposite of what most \"progressive\" people try to make), but we also need MORE arrests, especially for those who use them regularly! Most people hate drug dealers, indeed, and there's death penalty for them in some countries (even though I strongly oppose it, I think it's wise given that it's still used in the US because drugs kill MORE people than any murderer!), but why do we tend to be so criminally \"OK\" with even teenagers using them?! I don't mean people from deprived households or homeless - they have very few choices living in such conditions. There're too many \"respectable\" people who do \"light\" (like \"pot\") drugs, and this should be stopped! People are so open about this even in states or countries where it's still illegal, and I don't understand why the police don't arrest them?? People are punished even for wacthing child p\\*\\*\\*\\*grahy, but why is it so not so \"serious\" when it comes to drugs?! I watch films and series for youth, and it makes me sick how common it is and portrayed as something almost \"normal\" even among middle and upper classes!! I don't support a full ban on drugs (some people, like the terminally ill, really need such medication), but it should not be something \"ordinary\" and easily available. We can't forbid drugs like alcohol or smoking, but other things should definitely stay illegal, and the law must be used actively on everyone without any \"indulgence\".",

It's impossible not to resonate with a cause that empowers the most vulnerable in our society that are directly exploited because of their vulnerability and lack of voice. As far as I was aware, that was what the movement was towards: to give opportunity and louder voice for those who suffered because of it, not a ethical or legal loophole where justice is tossed out the window.\n\n\nThis view has been building in me but the recent Joe Gato accusation was just absurd. Sure the guy may be a creep but that's not against the law, these women willingly and even suggestively approached him, even going to his hotel room intoxicated. The common defense is, \"she may have changed her mind\" or \" maybe he was violent\" and yes, those are possibilities but it should be verifiable. \n\n\n\"Believe Women\", is for women who have been suppressed and fear their voices won't be heard. These women seem to be suppressors and their voices louder than the law it self. ",

    "text": "I specifically have in mind members of the political class here, like Congress. I can't speak for ordinary protestors and town hall attendees, since I don't know the precise political views of those people.\n\nAnyway, I trust the left to defend us from an authoritarian coup more than I trust the centrist establishment. This is partly based on things they are actually doing, and partly based on the differences between progressive and centrist approaches to politics.\n\nAs far as what they are actually doing goes, members of the progressive caucus, like Bernie Sanders, AOC, and Greg Casar, are touring the country, engaging in public activism against Trump. To my knowledge, no left-of-center democrat is doing that.\n\nMembers of the left are also putting up a more unified front against the legislative agenda of Trump's republican congress. Moderate democrats are more split: everyone in the progressive caucus voted to filibuster the republican spending bill. So did many moderates, but a contingent of them in the Senate voted not to, which ultimately led to its passage. (Schumer\u2019s argument for doing so was weak\u2014if Trump wanted a shutdown, he wouldn\u2019t have been whipping votes for the spending bill in when it reached the House floor.)\n\nThe progressive caucus unilaterally opposed Trump's cabinet picks. Center-leaning democrats helped vote many of them in. Trump's cabinet, composed of unscrupulous loyalists, has been a key part of his authoritarian agenda.\n\nIt's no surprise the left is fighting harder. History shows that moderates often capitulate more quickly than the left to rising right-wing authoritarian movements. Germany's centrist Zentrum Party, for example, submitted to the Nazis faster than the leftist Social Democratic Party, which continued to resist Hitler even after the signing of the Enabling Act.  If Trump's authoritarian attacks continue to intensify and he starts violently targetting citizens or even politicians who disagree with him, I guarantee you people in the center will very quickly start to support him while progressives continue to speak out, even at risk to themselves.\n\nWhat else would one expect? As the political spectrum in America shifts right, so does the center. And as the right becomes authoritarian, centrists trickle in behind them. Their fixation on compromise makes them especially vulnerable to capitulation, unlike progressives, whose politics are grounded in a set of moral and political principles rather than a midpoint between extremes. This is why I'm not a moderate.",

When, say, two countries can source specific things at a lower cost than the other can, both sides would benefit if they trade those lower cost assets with each other.\n\nTake Canada for example. Canada has lower cost steel, aluminum, lumber, oil, etc. But Canada wants American products like cars, and refined oil (gasoline and diesel), planes, software, a slew of things.  \nIt's claimed that Canada has a trade deficit, but when you remove the crude oil import, Canada does not have a deficit, but a slight surplus even. The US and Canada has (bad) a very healthy trade arrangement. Both countries benefited from each other, and collectively the cost of goods were lower than what they would have been had it all been sourced domestically.\n\nWhy change that? Sure, one might see one particular industry get a boost by using tariffs to prevent import, but that gain is much lower than the amount lost from reduced export!\n\nTrade agreement are incredibly beneficial for both sides when you trade with a partner where each side has things to offer to each other. US-Canada trade is probably the world's very best example of the most successful most prosperous most mutually beneficial arrangement that his planet has ever seen.\n\nHow can people just let all this get destroyed just like that? Why are some people not getting it?  \nThings are not going to an era where America was great. America will not be great without strong healthy trade arrangements. People need to organize and make it clear to Trump that what is happening now only is good for a few things, but that it is shortsighted to focus only on the few upsides, when there is a far greater downside that takes away from it all!\n\nThe amount gained from producing domestically is FAR LESS than the amount lost from LOST exports!\n\nAnd this is not to say that things shouldn't be produced domestically! Absolutely go ahead and try to compete by creating anything domestically where possible! But for things like lumber, aluminum, steel, crude oil, etc, Canada has it for much less and wants to keep the world's strongest trade going because it is an absolutely win-win equally for both sides.  \nAbsolutely try to use local lumber, and been up aluminum production. But do that without slowing trade!  \nTariffs come with retaliation. That retaliation is more costly than its gains. Each side would end up doing everything more expensively.\n\nStop the destruction of the world's most powerful and mutually beneficial trade arrangement !!!",

A brutally honest person would tell him he is the repellent/stain he feels like he is bc his victim act is unpleasant to be around and people can pick up on his insecurities and negative energy. No one wants to be subjected to that. Someone who is more tactful, would reframe it to callout that he needs to work on improving how he feels about himself bc he can\u2019t form a meaningful or healthy relationship with others when he has a deep seeded hatred for himself. The way he feels about himself likely manifests in his interactions with people. (And it did.)\n\nI personally feel like if you prefer brutal honesty, you enjoy being degraded. The later is just as effective at telling that person what they need to hear w/o being rude.\n\n\n\n",

I will go down and describe why.\n\nInternal issues: The U.S does have a problem of democratic institutions being worn away, however these are mostly short term issues that can be fixed or majorly adjusted by a more democratic administration post Trump, especially since Trump himself won\u2019t be in office forever and republicans have no real replacement post-Trump. America falling into civil war is also (IMO) nonsense due to how comfortable most people\u2019s lives are.\n\nLack of replacements: Let\u2019s face it, this is the main crux of my argument. There is no real replacement for the U.S even if it gets weaker, even ignoring its sheer number of alliances and its overwhelming cultural influence (only matched by Japan, an American ally) \n\n1. Europe is far too divided and too buerecratic to pose a reasonable economic challenge to the U.S, and militarily it has decades before it can catch up, also has very poor demographics and immigration.\n\n2. China\u2019s demographics are extremely bad due to the one child policy and they are already depopulating.\n\nNot only this, but de-dollarization is incredibly unlikely. China\u2019s currency is too weak to replace the dollar, the USD being the worlds reserve currency is held up by its navy, and Europe has all these issues with the added fact they have no willingness to replace the dollar\n\nTo CMV, I would like a fairly realistic way that America would be dethroned from the world stage as a major global power.",

    "text": "The Supreme Court, and Chief Justice Roberts in particular, have been catching a lot of flak lately for their decision upholding presidential immunity *for official acts*.  This is a straightforward application of the longstanding doctrine of [sovereign immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity_in_the_United_States).  If presidents were *not* immune for their official acts, the result would be chaos -- any business who has to pay more to comply with a federal regulation could sue a president *personally*.  The litigation would be endless because executive action takes place through myriad regualtions.  Should former President Joe Biden have had to cower in fear of future lawsuits just for exercising the powers he was duly given to exercise?\n\nThe proper venue to deal with a president's official acts you disagree with is the ballot box.\n\nAnd that's the underlying issue.  We're dealing with President Trump's sh-t **because the American people put him into office, again.**  Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority *upholding ObamaCare* against a conservative challenge to the law:\n\n> **It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.**\n\n[National Federation of Independent Business vs. Sebelius](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/567/519/#tab-opinion-1970522)\n\nThat principle applies as much to upholding the Affordable Care Act (which many of us like) as to presidential immunity for official acts.  It is the job of a judge is to apply legal principles evenly.  This is fundamental to the rule of law.\n\nIf we don't like Donald Trump's official acts, then we shouldn't have voted him into office.\n\nIt can't be any other way.  The foundation of our political system has to be, it must be, the people.  That's what our whole system is about.  We get the government we deserve.  Benjamin Franklin said, \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"  Why doesn't America deserve Trump as president?  A selfish people with a lack of self-awareness wanted a strongman to hurt others, but end up getting hurt themselves.\n\nNow I know that not all of us voted for Trump.  But \"not my president\" exhibits a different kind of selfishness -- that of a smug moral superiority and the associated belief that we had nothing to do with others' stupid political views.  Well, where did that get us?  Think back to the political discourses we might have had with someone on \"the other side.\"  Was it more about trying to convince them, or about us being right?  If you were them, would your vote have been swayed by how you went about your \"advocacy\" or \"activism?\"  Those whose are eating crow now from their vote for Trump (reddit is lit up these days with Trump voter who lost their job, or had their aid or funding cut, etc.) are eating a huge slice of humble pie.  But I think even those of us who voted against Trump could stand to take at least a sliver too.",

    "text": "The ongoing Israel-Gaza war persists because Hamas refuses to surrender, despite having no realistic chance of military victory. Israel's overwhelming military advantage has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas fighters and infrastructure and it is only getting worse. And rather than capitulating when faced with destruction, as is typically the case in military conflict, Hamas continues to fight, prolonging the war and exacerbating suffering for civilians in Gaza.\n\nWhat many in the West seem to forget - or are perhaps unaware of - is that Hamas is operating with an extremist religious ideology that views martyrdom as preferable to humiliation in defeat. \n\nIt's why Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida said \"You love life the way we love death.\" \n\nIt's why top Hamas leader Khaled Mashal said that 2 million dead Palestinians is worth it for the liberation of the entire land. Sadly, people seem to lack even a basic understanding of Hamas' worldview and how little they care for the lives of their own people.\n\nHamas' radical interpretation of Islam glorifies dying in battle as an act of faith and resistance. This belief system abhors surrender as the ultimate defeat, betrayal, and humiliation, even if a diplomatic solution would protect Palestinian lives and put an end to the bloodshed. Because of this, Hamas isn't operating by the same logic we saw with the Germans and Japanese in WW2 where military defeat leads to surrender and peace. Hamas' ideology, and its commitment to endless resistance explains why they prioritize symbolic acts of defiance over pragmatic goals.\n\nPeople understandably want an end to war, and yet calls for Hamas to surrender are nowhere to be found. The idea that Hamas can remain in power is untenable to anyone actually familiar with Hamas' long history of brutality and what the group stands for.\n\nIn light of all of the above, it's no surprise that Hamas refuses to surrender, and why all of their stipulations to hand back the hostages come with bizarre conditions that would allow them to claim at least an illusion of victory, even in the face of devastating losses. Their entire belief system emphasizes struggle over compromise and an admission of loss, which only reinforces the idea that surrender is not an option, regardless of the cost to Gaza\u2019s population.\n\nUnlike conflicts where one side concedes after suffering overwhelming losses, Hamas sees perpetual struggle as an inherent duty. The end result is that you have Israel trying to get its hostages back and Hamas willing to sacrafice every Palestinian rather than surrender. It's a death cult mentality that is apparent to anyone willing to look at Hamas with objective eyes.",

    "text": "I am an agnostic, but I give a respectably high probability to the possibility of God\u2019s existence. It\u2019s hard to lock numbers down completely, but if I had to I\u2019d put the probability that at least one god exists at around 30%, and the probability that none exist at about 70%. \n\nI think the best argument for God\u2019s existence is what I would call the \u201cargument from hierarchal cause\u201d, which I will make shortly. I\u2019d like to caveat that I\u2019m not necessarily arguing specifically for the Christian God, nor of only one god: I\u2019ll use \u201cGod\u201d as a shorthand for \u201cat least one extremely powerful creator deity\u201d.\n\nOkay, so here\u2019s the argument:-\n\nCauses broadly fall into two categories: temporal causes and hierarchal causes. Suppose I were to set a chain of dominoes falling over in sequence: this is a temporal cause, because I caused the first domino to fall which causes the second which causes the third and so on, but once the chain of causality is started you can remove any domino from the chain after it has fallen and the causality continues.\n\nBy hierarchal cause, I mean something more like this situation: I hold a phone in my hand, which is held up by arm, which is held by my shoulder, and then my torso, and then the rest of my body. Then the ground I\u2019m standing upon, then the ground below that, and so on\u2026\n\nUnlike temporal causes, you can\u2019t remove an element from a hierarchal cause without it having a knock-on effect: if we remove my shoulder then my arm, hand, and phone all fall to the ground.\n\nThe question is: was the universe caused by a temporal cause, a hierarchal cause, or something else?\n\nThe Big Bang is literally the beginning of space and time. Therefore, the universe cannot have been caused by a temporal cause because there was no time for the cause to take place in. Absent some other possibility, it seems likely that the universe was caused by a hierarchal cause.\n\nIf the universe was caused by a hierarchal cause, then it seems plausible that it may have been caused by an agential hierarchal cause, which we call \u201cGod\u201d. It isn\u2019t strictly the only possibility, like maybe there\u2019s some rule of maths which grounds all of reality, but that still has a lot of explaining to do: where did the maths come from? It seems metaphysically weird for some brute fact to exist, like some law of maths or physics, but an omnipotent (or near-omnipotent) being having brute existence feels at least a little bit more intuitively plausible to me, though I\u2019m not sure why.\n\nI think the strengths of the argument are:-\n\n- it is sound. The conclusions seem to follow from its premises.\n\n- it is valid. Its premises do seem to be true.\n\n- it increases our posterior probability of God\u2019s existence compared to some other prior. It doesn\u2019t get us certainty, but it does seem to make God\u2019s existence more likely than if we had not heard this argument.\n\nI think the weaknesses are:-\n\n- hierarchal versus temporal causes might be a false dichotomy. If so, there would have to be some other type of cause which plausibly could have caused the universe.\n\n- it doesn\u2019t get us certainty, so it\u2019s weaker than any argument which is both sound and valid and which does conclude with certainty that God exists.\n\n- the jump to an agential hierarchal cause seems somewhat weak, it\u2019s hard to justify rigorously. \n\nI think in order to change my view you would have to do one or more of these:-\n\n- prove with certainty that God exists. If you can do this, then whatever argument you use to do so is obviously stronger.\n\n- prove with certainty that God does not exist. If you can do this, then all arguments for the existence of God are equally bad.\n\n- give a stronger argument for the existence of God. \n\n- show that the hierarchal cause versus temporal causes is a false dichotomy and that some other type of cause which plausibly might have lead to the universe is possible.\n\n- show that time did not begin at the Big Bang (though even if you could prove this it would likely involve maths that is so advanced that I can\u2019t properly understand it)\n\n- show that we should assign a higher priority probability to a non-agential hierarchal cause than an agential one.\n\n- point out some other flaw in the argument.\n\nThanks for reading, I look forward to hearing your thoughts!",

    "text": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussion about how men can be entitled in dating, friendships, and emotional expression. But I rarely see conversations about how certain behaviors and expectations from women can also be harmful to young men.\n\nFor example, men are constantly told that it\u2019s their job to initiate relationships, approach, plan, lead. But when they struggle with this and express frustration, they\u2019re often dismissed as \"entitled\" or told to just \"try harder.\" Meanwhile, many women still expect to be courted without taking on any of that effort themselves. Isn\u2019t that also a form of entitlement?\n\nThere\u2019s also the assumption that men only pursue relationships for sex. Personally, I (and a lot of other guys) crave emotional connection, someone to actually listen, care, and make us feel safe. Yes, sex is a factor, but acting like it\u2019s all men want is just as reductive as saying all women are only after money. At its worst, this mindset leads to manipulation, where sex is used as a tool for control or where men\u2019s emotional needs are completely ignored.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve noticed is how socially awkward or quiet guys are sometimes treated. Some conventionally attractive women will go out of their way to talk to \"awkward\" guys, but it doesn\u2019t always feel like genuine interest. It can feel performative, like a self-esteem boost or a way to look good in front of others. And if a quiet guy just keeps to himself, he risks being labeled a \"creep\" or even an \"incel\" for simply existing in the wrong space. This makes it even harder for shy or socially anxious guys to feel comfortable around women.\n\nThen there\u2019s the way women can bully men, which doesn\u2019t get talked about much. Fake asking someone out as a joke, spreading damaging rumors, or socially isolating them, these things happen, and they can really mess with a guy\u2019s confidence. I\u2019ve personally overheard women talking behind their friends' backs way more often than I ever have in male friend groups, yet social aggression is usually framed as a \"male\" problem.\n\nAnd what about the expectation that men should have the same level of emotional intelligence as women? Many guys struggle with recognizing or expressing emotions, not because they don\u2019t care, but because they weren\u2019t taught how. Some only develop these skills in therapy, which costs time and money. But if a guy struggles emotionally, he\u2019s often told to \"just communicate better\" while being judged for not already having the ability to navigate feelings like a seasoned pro. If emotional intelligence is something that has to be learned, does that mean men are expected to pay a financial cost just to be considered relationship material?\n\nWhen you put all of this together, it\u2019s not surprising that so many young men feel lost. They\u2019re struggling in school, falling behind in college enrollment, and still expected to be financially successful while receiving less and less support. Meanwhile, many women still prefer partners who are high-earning and emotionally mature but don\u2019t always acknowledge the barriers that men face in getting there.\n\nI\u2019m not saying all women behave this way, and I\u2019m not excusing harmful male behavior either. I just think some of these issues go ignored, and they contribute to why so many young men feel disconnected and frustrated.",

    "text": "First, note that the word \"earn\" has a moral connotation and carries an expectation of entitlement. If my mom promised me I can play two hours of video games if I get my chores done, I will have \"earned\" the right to play two hours of video games after I am done with chores. I would be wrong of her to still refuse to let me play video games after I do the chores.\n\nThis reasoning transfers quite comfortably to the working world. Boss promises to pay me $60,000 per year to dig ditches. I dig ditches all year and he gives me $60,000. However, there are some important caveats here that make the expectation of \"earning\" different.\n\nFirst, someone in another country or market makes a different amount of money for the same amount of work. Digging ditches pays a lot better in the United States than it does in Cambodia. I dig the same number of ditches in a year as a worker in Cambodia yet get paid twice as much to do it. Then how is it that I \"earned\" twice as much as him? Am I twice as morally good? Most people would agree not. Circumstances that are out of both of our control make his labor less valuable, but I think it is fair to say that we both \"earned\" the same amount because we both worked equally hard.\n\nSo, does mean someone is getting paid too much or someone is not getting paid enough? Some would say no. After all the cost of living is cheaper in Cambodia. Maybe it would be fairer to say that we both earned\u00a0*a living*, regardless of the actual dollar amount we are paid. We have earned the right to live comfortably for our hard work. As long as the money we are paid is enough to do that, all is well. But the actual dollar amount is irrelevant.\n\nIf you work in the ditch digging industry and make $50,000 while all the other ditch diggers earn $60k, you might say you \"earned\" $10,000 more than you got (assuming you work just as hard as the other ditch diggers). But this is just lazy shorthand. It would be more accurate to say you earned the same pay as the rest of them, or that you earned the same standard of living as them. Again, think of the ditch diggers in Cambodia.\n\nWhen you try to convert how much you \"earn\" to dollars (or any other currency), it inevitably leads to complications like this. Especially when you consider things like how the Federal Reserve controls the value of dollars via interest rates, the printing of new money, and taxes. The dollar amount you \"earn\" is relative to other people in your industry\u00a0*as well as*\u00a0countless other factors out of your control such as the country you live in, the economic situation of the world, the value of the currency you are paid in...\n\nWhen your boss says \"I will pay you $60,000 to dig ditches,\" he is really saying \\*before taxes.\\* Everybody gotta pay taxes. And the government basically steals like $20,000 of that, right? Well, we know that really we didn't earn $60,000. We earned the lifestyle that we expect a person with $60,000 would have. For example if extreme inflation somehow happened overnight and a dollar today is worth what fifty cents was worth yesterday, you would be angry if you were still paid just $60,000.\n\nIn America, when a job offers to pay you a certain amount, we automatically factor in the effect of taxes when we consider how much that is actually worth. Everybody around us pays taxes. We calculate the lifestyle we expect someone who makes $60,000/yr to have based on people we see with that income living in the world. They pay taxes too.\n\nAll of this is to say: taxation is not theft. Money is merely the medium through which we distribute value earned. That does not mean it represents the exact amount we earned. When you see deductions from your paycheck for taxes that is not a reduction of how much you earned because the same deductions are happening for everyone else. You are still getting the lifestyle you expect someone who makes your base salary to get. You are not being cheated unless you are getting less than the lifestyle you reasonably expect. You cannot reasonably expect a lifestyle that is the same as everybody else who makes the same amount as you PLUS taxes you paid. This misconception puts people in a constant state offense that the money they \"earned\" is being taken. But you didn't actually earn a specific dollar amount as much as you earned a lifestyle.\n\nI could go on about how government policy creates the conditions that allow you to be compensated at a far greater rate than the person in Cambodia but that is a whole, even more complex conversation in and of itself. It just annoys me a lot when people complain about how much the government \"steals\" from them with no appreciation for the fluid and relative value of money. You earned exactly as much as you got after taxes because after-tax income is what sets your expectations.\n\nIf that's not enough it's not automatically because the government is stealing from you. It is just as much because your job isn't paying you enough, or even global socioeconomic conditions that cause it. But you cannot just default to the government because they are the ones who add minus signs to your paycheck.",

It feels like there is a much better way to get your point across if you feel two people are actually equal and it's a genuine pick'em.",

    "text": "First and foremost, I am not a Trump supporter. I do not think his policies align with my viewpoints whatsoever. \n\nThat being said, I feel as if he is unfairly targeted by media outlets. I feel as if his words are routinely taken out of context. When they are put into their proper context, they are significantly less abrasive than the media seems to report. In all honesty, I have not been keeping up as much with recent news for my mental health, so I am speaking more of his 2016 - 2020 term. \n\nSome examples: \n\n**\"Very Fine People\" Comment:**\n\n*\u201cWhat about the alt-left that came charging at, as you say, at the alt-right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo they have any semblance of guilt?\u201d* \n\n*\u201cI\u2019ve condemned neo-Nazis. I\u2019ve condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me,\u201d he said.* \n\n*\u201cYou had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe press has treated them absolutely unfairly.\u201d \u201cYou also had some very fine people on both sides,\u201d he said.* \n\n\\- Trump did not defend the neo-Nazis or white nationalist, only those who where there in support of General Lee. \n\n**Fish Feed in China Incident:**\n\n[https://nextshark.com/donald-trump-feeding-fish-meme-real-story](https://nextshark.com/donald-trump-feeding-fish-meme-real-story)\n\n\\- Trump was not being disrespectful of their culture and was actually following the lead of PM Abe. \n\n**\"They are sending their worst\":** \n\n*\"When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d*\n\n*-* I don't see an issue with this statement. For the most part, large swaths of illegal immigration is human trafficking and drug trafficking. \n\nObviously, there are a million examples. To me, the media has been corrupted and cares more about clicks than journalistic integrity. Just like their reporting on plane crashes being misleading. The media has inherent bias and Trump has called them on it from the beginning. That is why I think we see so much negative reporting of Trump, specifically with altered context. \n\nTo Change My View: Please provide me with examples of when the media accurately reported on his behaviors with full context.
